They may also have depression or other mental health concerns.\nWhen people die by suicide, it affects their family, friends, and community. They may feel grief, shock, anger, and guilt. Some may develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, or anxiety . They may also be at risk for suicidal thoughts.\nWho is at risk for suicide?\nSuicide does not discriminate. It can touch anyone, anywhere, at any time. But there are certain factors that can contribute to the risk of suicide, including:\nHaving attempted suicide before\nDepression and other mental health disorders\nAlcohol or drug use disorder\nFamily history of a mental health disorder\nFamily history of an alcohol or drug use disorder\nFamily history of suicide\nFamily violence, including intimate partner violence , child abuse , or sexual abuse\nHaving guns in the home\nBeing in or having recently gotten out of prison or jail\nBeing exposed to others' suicidal behavior, such as a family member, peer, or celebrity\nMedical illness, including chronic pain\nStressful life event, such as a job loss, financial problems, loss of a loved one, a breakup of a relationship, etc.\nBeing between the ages of 15 and 24 years or over age 60\nWhat are the warning signs for suicide?\nThe warning signs for suicide include:\nTalking about wanting to die or wanting to kill oneself\nMaking a plan or looking for a way to kill oneself, such as searching online\nBuying a gun or stockpiling pills\nFeeling empty, hopeless, trapped, or like there's no reason to live\nBeing in unbearable pain\nTalking about being a burden to others\nUsing more alcohol or drugs\nActing anxious or agitated; behaving recklessly\nSleeping too little or too much\nWithdrawing from family or friends or feeling isolated\nShowing rage or talking about seeking revenge\nDisplaying extreme mood swings\nSaying good-bye to loved ones, putting affairs in order\nSome people may tell others about their suicidal thoughts.

Learn the signs of bullying, and how to help a child who is being bullied.", "body_text": "What is bullying?\nBullying is when a person or group repeatedly harms someone on purpose. It can be physical, social, and/or verbal. It is harmful to both the victims and the bullies, and it always involves:\nAggressive behavior.\nA difference in power, meaning that the victim is weaker or is seen as weaker. For example, bullies may try to use physical strength, embarrassing information, or popularity to harm others.\nRepetition, meaning it happens more than once or that it probably will happen again\nWhat are the types of bullying?\nThere are three types of bullying:\nPhysical bullying involves hurting a person's body or belongings. Examples include hitting, kicking, and stealing or breaking someone's stuff.\nSocial bullying (also called relational bullying) hurts someone's reputation or relationships. Some examples are spreading rumors, embarrassing someone in public, and making someone feel left out.\nVerbal bullying is saying or writing mean things, including name-calling, taunting, and threatening\nWhat is cyberbullying?\nCyberbullying is bullying that happens through text messages or online. It could be through emails, social media, forums, or gaming. Some examples are:\nPosting rumors on social media\nSharing embarrassing pictures or videos online\nSharing someone else's private information online (doxing)\nMaking threats against someone online\nCreating fake accounts and posting information to embarrass someone\nCertain types of cyberbullying can be illegal. The laws on cyberbullying are different from state to state.\nHow is cyberbullying different from bullying?\nCyberbullying is a type of bullying, but there are some differences between the two. Cyberbullying can be:\nAnonymous - people can hide their identities when they are online or using a cell phone\nPersistent - people can send messages instantly, at any time of the day or night\nPermanent - a lot of electronic communication is permanent and public, unless it's reported and removed. A bad online reputation can affect getting into college, getting a job, and other areas of life. This applies to the bully as well.\nHard to notice - teachers and parents may not overhear or see cyberbullying taking place\nWhich children are more likely to be bullied?\nChildren are more likely to be bullied if they:\nAre seen as different from their peers, such as being overweight or underweight, dressing differently, or being of a different race/ethnicity\nAre seen as weak\nHave depression , anxiety , or low self-esteem\nDon't have many friends or are less popular\nDon't socialize well with others\nHave an intellectual or developmental disability\nWhich children are more likely to be bullies?\nThere are two types of children who are more likely to bully others:\nChildren who are well-connected to peers, have social power, are overly worried about popularity, and like to be in charge of others\nChildren who are more isolated from peers, may be depressed or anxious, have low self-esteem, are easily pressured by peers, and have trouble understanding other people's feelings\nThere are certain factors that make someone more likely to be a bully. They include:\nBeing aggressive or easily frustrated\nHaving trouble at home, such as violence or bullying in the home or having uninvolved parents\nHaving trouble following rules\nSeeing violence positively\nHaving friends who bully others\nWhat are the effects of bullying?\nBullying is a serious problem that causes harm. And it doesn't just hurt the person who is being bullied; it can also be harmful for the bullies and for any kids who witness the bullying.\nKids who are bullied can have problems at school and with their mental and physical health. They are at risk for:\nDepression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. These problems sometimes last into adulthood.\nHealth complaints, including headaches and stomachaches\nLower grades and test scores\nMissing and dropping out of school\nKids who bully others have a higher risk for substance use, problems in school, and violence later in life.\nKids who witness bullying are more likely to abuse drugs or alcohol and have mental health problems. They may also miss or skip school.\nWhat are the signs of being bullied?\nOften, kids who are being bullied don't report it. They may fear a backlash from the bully, or they may think that no one cares. Sometimes they feel too ashamed to talk about it. So it is important to know the signs of a bullying problem:\nDepression, loneliness, or anxiety\nLow self-esteem\nHeadaches, stomachaches, or poor eating habits\nDisliking school, not wanting to go to school, or getting worse grades than before\nSelf-destructive behaviors, such as running away from home, harming themselves , or talking about suicide\nUnexplained injuries\nLost or destroyed clothing, books, electronics, or jewelry\nTrouble sleeping or frequent nightmares\nSudden loss of friends or avoidance of social situations\nHow do you help someone who is being bullied?\nTo help a child who is being bullied, support the child and address the bullying behavior:\nListen and focus on the child. Learn what's been going on and show you want to help.\nAssure the child that bullying is not his/her fault\nKnow that kids who are bullied may struggle with talking about it. Consider referring them to a school counselor, psychologist, or other mental health service.\nGive advice about what to do. This may involve role-playing and thinking through how the child might react if the bullying occurs again.\nWork together to resolve the situation and protect the bullied child. The child, parents, and school or organization should be part of the solution.\nFollow up. Bullying may not end overnight. Make sure that the child knows that you are committed to making it stop.\nMake sure that the bully knows that his or her behavior is wrong and harms others\nShow kids that bullying is taken seriously. Make it clear to everyone that the bullying will not be tolerated.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services", "content_hash": "27ebfdda0b4417120dea1e02aa633151f3a2b93e589c532f1706382dd23eeebe", "word_count": 960, "char_count": 5941, "text_length": "long", "readability_score": 9.482, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["bullying", "bullied", "cyberbullying", "child", "kids", "children", "school", "bully", "social", "online"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "Bullying is when a person or group repeatedly harms someone on purpose.

Learn how to evaluate medical findings.", "body_text": "Almost every day, new findings from medical research are published in scientific journals. These journal articles often become sources for news stories. They can be important tools in helping you manage your health. But it's not always easy to understand them and know what they mean for your life. For example:\nWhat you hear about a study may not explain how it fits into the bigger picture.\nSometimes the results of one study seem to disagree with the results of another study. That could be because the studies could have different designs and asked different questions. The news stories don't always explain this.\nSometimes the studies are very small, and researchers need to do more studies to confirm the results. But the news stories about these small studies may not highlight this.\nSo it's important to think carefully when reading or listening to reports of new medical findings. Here are some questions that can help you evaluate that information :\nWas the study in animals or humans? Getting certain results in animals may not mean that you get those same results in humans.\nWere the people in the study similar to you in ways that may matter, such as age, race, or sex?\nHow big was the study? Larger studies may get more reliable results than smaller studies.\nHow long did the study last? For example, studies testing medicines need to be long enough to show long-term benefits or risks.\nWhat kind of study was it? Clinical trials , especially randomized controlled trials, give the clearest information about whether a treatment is effective and safe in humans. In randomized controlled trials, the people in the study are randomly divided into separate groups that get different treatments. This helps prevent bias in the results.\nWhere was the research done?\nIf a new treatment was being tested, what were the side effects? How common were they?\nHow do the results from the study compare with previous studies? If the new study had different results, then more studies would be needed to confirm these results.\nWho paid for the research? Sometimes the people paying for the research could profit financially if the study gets certain results.\nWho is reporting the results?

Even though they all have disabilities, they can have a wide range of needs. For example, even people who have same type of disability can be affected in very different ways. Also, some disabilities are \"visible\" (easy to see), for example when someone is in a wheelchair. But other disabilities are \"invisible\" (hidden or not easy to see), such as problems with hearing, thinking, or learning.\nWhat causes disabilities?\nDisabilities can have different causes. Some disabilities are present at birth, while others may happen later in life.\nCauses of disabilities that are present at birth can include:\nDisorders in single genes , such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy\nDisorders of chromosomes, such as Down syndrome\nExposures (before birth) to infections or substances , such as drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes\nCauses of disabilities that happen later in life can include:\nInjuries, such as spinal cord injuries , traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), and back injuries\nChronic (long-lasting) diseases, such as diabetes , heart disease , kidney disease , COPD , and arthritis\nCancer\nMental health problems\nStroke\nAlzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia\nHow can disabilities affect your health?\nHaving a disability does not mean a person cannot be healthy.

It's also important for people with disabilities to get health care that meets their needs as a whole person, not just as a person with a disability.\nHow can people with disabilities get and stay healthy?\nJust like for people who don't have a disability, having a healthy lifestyle is important for people who do have a disability. A healthy lifestyle includes:\nGetting regular physical activity\nEating healthy foods in healthy portions\nLimiting sun exposure and using sunscreen to prevent skin cancer\nNot smoking, and if needed, getting help to quit smoking\nUsing medicines wisely\nNot drinking alcohol or drinking in moderation\nGetting help for any substance use or mental health problems\nStaying in touch with family and friends\nWhat kinds of resources are there for people with disabilities?\nManaging a disability can sometimes be challenging. There are resources that can help:\nAssistive devices and mobility aids can make daily tasks easier.\nSchools can develop plans around the specific needs of a child with a disability. The goal of the plans is to give the child an opportunity to perform at the same level as other children their age.\nSupport networks, such as disability organizations, can help you learn more about resources for you and your family. Support groups can help you connect with other people who have the same disability. They can provide emotional and social support.

You can have just one risk factor, but people often have several of them together. When you have at least three of them, it is called metabolic syndrome. These risk factors include:\nA large waistline, also called abdominal obesity or \"having an apple shape.\" Too much fat around the stomach is a greater risk factor for heart disease than too much fat in other parts of the body.\nHaving a high triglyceride level. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood.\nHaving a low HDL cholesterol level . HDL is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.\nHaving high blood pressure . If your blood pressure stays high over time, it can damage your heart and lead to other health problems.\nHaving a high fasting blood sugar . Mildly high blood sugar may be an early sign of diabetes.\nThe more factors you have, the higher your risk for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke is.\nWhat causes metabolic syndrome?\nMetabolic syndrome has several causes that act together:\nOverweight and obesity\nAn inactive lifestyle\nInsulin resistance, a condition in which the body can't use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into your cells to give them energy. Insulin resistance can lead to high blood sugar levels.\nAge - your risk goes up as get older\nGenetics - ethnicity and family history\nPeople who have metabolic syndrome often also have excessive blood clotting and inflammation throughout the body. Researchers don't know whether these conditions cause metabolic syndrome or worsen it.\nWho is at risk for metabolic syndrome?\nThe most important risk factors for metabolic syndrome are:\nAbdominal obesity (a large waistline)\nAn inactive lifestyle\nInsulin resistance\nThere are certain groups of people who have an increased risk of metabolic syndrome:\nSome racial and ethnic groups. Mexican Americans have the highest rate of metabolic syndrome, followed by White and Black people.\nPeople who have diabetes\nPeople who have a sibling or parent who has diabetes\nWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nPeople who take medicines that cause weight gain or changes in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugar levels\nWhat are the symptoms of metabolic syndrome?\nMost of the metabolic risk factors have no obvious signs or symptoms, except for a large waistline.\nHow is metabolic syndrome diagnosed?\nYour health care provider will diagnose metabolic syndrome based on the results of a physical exam and blood tests. You must have at least three of the risk factors to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome:\nA large waistline , which means a waist measurement of 35 inches or more for women 40 inches or more for men\n35 inches or more for women\n40 inches or more for men\nA high triglyceride level , which is 150 mg/dL or higher\nA low HDL cholesterol level , which is Less than 50 mg/dL for women Less than 40 mg/dL for men\nLess than 50 mg/dL for women\nLess than 40 mg/dL for men\nHigh blood pressure , which is a reading of 130/85 mmHg or higher.\nA high fasting blood sugar , which is 100 mg/dL or higher\nWhat are the treatments for metabolic syndrome?\nThe most important treatment for metabolic syndrome is a heart-healthy lifestyle, which includes:\nA heart-healthy eating plan, which limits the amount of saturated and trans fats that you eat. It encourages you to choose a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats.\nAiming for a healthy weight\nManaging stress\nGetting regular physical activity\nQuitting smoking (or not starting if you don't already smoke)\nIf making lifestyle changes is not enough, you may need to take medicines.

Healthy eating, regular exercise, and weight control may help prevent or delay getting diabetes.", "body_text": "What is type 2 diabetes?\nIf you have diabetes, your blood sugar levels are too high. With type 2 diabetes , this happens because your body does not make enough insulin, or it does not use insulin well (this is called insulin resistance). If you are at risk for type 2 diabetes, you might be able to prevent or delay developing it.\nWho is at risk for type 2 diabetes?\nMany Americans are at risk for type 2 diabetes. Your chances of getting it depend on a combination of risk factors such as your genes and lifestyle. The risk factors include:\nHaving prediabetes , which means you have blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes\nBeing overweight or having obesity\nBeing age 45 or older\nA family history of diabetes\nBeing African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander\nHaving high blood pressure\nHaving a low level of HDL (good) cholesterol or a high level of triglycerides\nA history of diabetes in pregnancy\nHaving given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more\nAn inactive lifestyle\nA history of heart disease or stroke\nHaving depression\nHaving polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nHaving acanthosis nigricans, a skin condition in which your skin becomes dark and thick, especially around your neck or armpits\nSmoking\nHow can I prevent or delay getting type 2 diabetes?\nIf you are at risk for diabetes, you may be able to prevent or delay getting it. Most of the things that you need to do involve having a healthier lifestyle. So if you make these changes, you will get other health benefits as well. You may lower your risk of other diseases, and you will probably feel better and have more energy. The changes are:\nLosing weight and keeping it off. Weight control is an important part of diabetes prevention. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes by losing 5 to 10% of your current weight. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose between 10 to 20 pounds. And once you lose the weight, it is important that you don't gain it back.\nFollowing a healthy eating plan. It is important to reduce the amount of calories you eat and drink each day, so you can lose weight and keep it off. To do that, your diet should include smaller portions and less fat and sugar. You should also eat a variety of foods from each food group, including plenty of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. It's also a good idea to limit red meat, and avoid processed meats.\nGet regular exercise. Exercise has many health benefits , including helping you to lose weight and lower your blood sugar levels. These both lower your risk of type 2 diabetes. Try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity 5 days a week. If you have not been active, talk with your health care professional to figure out which types of exercise are best for you. You can start slowly and work up to your goal.\nDon't smoke. Smoking can contribute to insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes. If you already smoke, try to quit .\nTalk to your health care provider to see whether there is anything else you can do to delay or to prevent type 2 diabetes.

Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps glucose get into your cells.\nWith type 1 diabetes , your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes , your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood glucose levels.\nPrediabetes means that your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.\nHow do the foods I eat affect my blood glucose levels?\nThe glucose in your blood comes from certain foods called carbohydrates , or \"carbs.\" Foods that are high in carbs include candy and sweets, sodas, breads, tortillas, and white rice. The more carbs you eat, the higher your blood glucose level will be. Some, but not all people with diabetes, may need to count the amount of carbs eaten in drinks and meals.\nWhether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, making the right food choices is an important way to keep your blood glucose at a level that is healthy for you. When you control your blood glucose, you lower your chance of having serious health problems from diabetes , such as vision loss and heart problems .\nAnd if you have prediabetes or are at risk for diabetes, eating foods that keep your blood glucose levels healthy may help prevent type 2 diabetes later on.\nWhat's the best diet for diabetes?\nThere isn't a specific diet or meal plan that works for everybody.

If you do drink, you should drink moderately. This means no more than one standard drink a day if you're a woman or two standard drinks a day if you're a man.\nWhat else do I need to know about diabetic diets?\nIf you have diabetes, it's important to eat the right amount of food every day. Your eating plan will include how much to eat, and help you choose the types of food for each meal or snack. If you take insulin, you may need to learn how to count carbs to help you know how much insulin to take.\nEating at the right times is also important.

When the disease develops during pregnancy, it is called gestational diabetes. It can be managed.", "body_text": "What is diabetes?\nIf you have diabetes , your blood glucose , or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes , your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes , your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood.\nWhat is gestational diabetes?\nSome people already have diabetes before they get pregnant. But others may develop diabetes during pregnancy. This type of diabetes is called gestational diabetes. It usually develops around the 24th week of pregnancy. It happens when your body can't make the extra insulin it needs during pregnancy. Researchers think gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy, along with genetic and lifestyle factors.\nWho is more likely to develop gestational diabetes?\nAnyone who is pregnant could develop gestational diabetes. But you are more likely to develop it if you:\nAre overweight or have obesity\nHave a family history of diabetes\nHad gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy\nHave given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more\nHave polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nAre African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander person\nHow do I know if I have gestational diabetes?\nGestational diabetes often has no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may be mild, such as being thirstier than normal or having to urinate (pee) more often.\nIf you are pregnant, you will most likely be screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. But if you have an increased chance of developing gestational diabetes, you may be tested during your first prenatal visit . Your health care provider will use one or more blood glucose tests to check for gestational diabetes. You may have the glucose challenge test, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or both.\nFor these two tests, you will drink a sugary liquid and wait for an hour before your blood sample is taken. If you have an oral glucose tolerance test, you will also get your blood drawn after 2 and 3 hours.\nHow can diabetes affect my pregnancy?\nHaving diabetes during pregnancy can affect your health. For example:\nYou are more likely to develop preeclampsia , a serious medical condition that causes a sudden increase in your blood pressure.\nYou are more likely to need a cesarean delivery , because your baby is more likely to be bigger than average.\nChanges to your hormones and your body during pregnancy can affect your blood glucose levels. If you had diabetes before pregnancy, you may now need to adjust your meal plan , physical activity routine, and/or medicines . If you have any diabetes health problems , they may get worse during pregnancy.\nGestational diabetes usually goes away after you have your baby. But you will be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\nHaving diabetes during pregnancy can also affect the health of your developing baby:\nIf you have high blood glucose levels at the beginning of your pregnancy, there is a higher risk of birth defects .\nYour baby will be at risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.\nYour baby is more likely to be born early .\nYour baby may have breathing problems or hypoglycemia (low blood glucose levels) right after birth.\nThere is a higher risk of miscarriage and stillbirth .\nHow can I manage diabetes during pregnancy?\nThere are steps you can take to manage your diabetes before, during, and after pregnancy.\nIf you already have diabetes, the best time to control your blood glucose is before you get pregnant . High blood glucose levels can be harmful to your developing baby during the first weeks of pregnancy, even before you know you are pregnant. See your provider to help you plan for pregnancy. You can talk about how to lower the risk of health problems for you and your developing baby. You can also discuss your diet, physical activity, and which diabetes medicines are safe during pregnancy .\nDuring your pregnancy, you will work with your provider to manage your blood glucose levels. You may be able to manage them with a healthy diet and regular physical activity. If that's not enough, then you will need to take diabetes medicines. It's also important that you:\nGet regular prenatal checkups\nTake your prenatal vitamins\nDon't use harmful substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs\nAfter pregnancy, there are steps you need to take to stay healthy:\nIf you had gestational diabetes, you are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. You will be tested for it within 4 to 12 weeks after giving birth. Even if your blood glucose levels have returned to normal, you will need to get them tested every 1 to 3 years.\nIf you already had diabetes before pregnancy, you and your provider will monitor changes to your blood glucose levels. They will tell you if you need to adjust your diabetes management plan.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases", "content_hash": "43cf10affe31edbc90047cbb7dbc3fb1cf34947b0904d9f5919114da9a229616", "word_count": 865, "char_count": 5064, "text_length": "long", "readability_score": 8.134, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["diabetes", "gestational diabetes", "pregnancy", "blood glucose", "blood glucose levels", "glucose", "blood", "gestational", "glucose levels", "baby"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "Some women already have diabetes before they get pregnant.

Glucose is your body's main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but it also comes from the food you eat. Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas. Insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, where it can be used for energy.\nIf you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin, can't use insulin as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high. Over time, high blood glucose levels can lead to serious health conditions . But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.\nWhat are the types of diabetes?\nThere are different types of diabetes:\nType 1 diabetes . If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin. It happens when your immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin.\nType 2 diabetes . This is the most common form of diabetes. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body may still be able to make insulin, but your cells don't respond well to insulin. They can't easily take up enough glucose from your blood.\nGestational diabetes . This is a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy.

Ovarian cancer is a cancerous tumor that forms in the tissues of an ovary. The ovaries are a pair of female reproductive glands that make eggs and female hormones .\nWhat are the types of ovarian cancer?\nThere are a few different types of ovarian cancer. The most common type is epithelial cancer. It begins in the cells that cover the ovary.\nThere are also two related types of epithelial cancer that can spread to the ovaries:\nFallopian tube cancer forms in the tissue lining a fallopian tube. The fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes on each side of the uterus. The uterus is the female reproductive organ where a fetus grows during pregnancy.\nPrimary peritoneal cancer forms in the tissue lining the peritoneum. Your peritoneum is a tissue lining that covers the organs in the abdomen (belly).\nThese two cancers are like ovarian cancer, and they have the same treatments. So some medical experts also consider those two types as ovarian cancer.\nSome other rarer types of ovarian cancer are malignant germ cell tumors and stromal tumors.\nWhat causes ovarian cancer?\nOvarian cancer happens when there are changes (mutations) in the genetic material (DNA). Often, the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown.\nMost ovarian cancers are caused by genetic changes that happen during your lifetime. But sometimes these genetic changes are inherited, meaning that you are born with them. Ovarian cancer that is caused by inherited genetic changes is called hereditary ovarian cancer.\nThere are also certain genetic changes that can raise your risk of ovarian cancer, including changes called BRCA1 and BRCA2 . These two changes also raise your risk of breast and other cancers.\nBesides genetics, your lifestyle and the environment can affect your risk of ovarian cancer.\nWho is more likely to develop ovarian cancer?\nCertain people are more likely to develop ovarian cancer. They include those who:\nHave a family history of ovarian cancer in a mother, aunt, grandmother, or sister\nHave inherited changes in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes\nHave certain other genetic conditions, such as Lynch syndrome\nHave endometriosis\nTook hormone replacement therapy\nAre overweight or have obesity\nAre tall\nAre older, especially those who have gone through menopause\nHave never been pregnant\nWhat are the symptoms of ovarian cancer?\nOvarian cancer may not cause early signs or symptoms. By the time you do have signs or symptoms, the cancer is often advanced.\nThe signs and symptoms may include:\nPain, swelling, or a feeling of pressure in the abdomen (belly) or pelvis\nSudden or frequent urge to urinate (pee)\nTrouble eating or feeling full\nA lump in the pelvic area\nGastrointestinal problems, such as gas , bloating, or constipation\nHow is ovarian cancer diagnosed?\nTo find out if you have ovarian cancer, your health care provider:\nWill ask about your medical history , including your symptoms\nWill ask about your family health history , including relatives who have had ovarian cancer\nWill do a physical exam , including a pelvic exam\nWill likely do imaging tests\nMay do blood tests such as a CA-125 blood test\nOften the only way to know for sure that you have ovarian cancer is by having a biopsy of the tissue. A biopsy is done during surgery to remove the tumor.\nWhat are the treatments for ovarian cancer?\nTreatments for ovarian cancer may include:\nSurgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible\nChemotherapy\nTargeted therapy , which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells\nYour provider may suggest that you have genetic testing to look for the gene changes that raise the risk for ovarian cancer.

Hyperthyroidism means the thyroid makes more thyroid hormones than the body needs.", "body_text": "What is hyperthyroidism?\nHyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs.\nYour thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. If not treated, hyperthyroidism can cause serious problems with your heart, bones, muscles, menstrual cycle, and fertility. But there are treatments that can help.\nWhat causes hyperthyroidism?\nHyperthyroidism has several causes. They include:\nGraves' disease, an autoimmune disorder in which your immune system attacks your thyroid and causes it to make too much hormone. This is the most common cause.\nThyroid nodules, which are growths on your thyroid. They are usually benign (not cancer). But they may become overactive and make too much thyroid hormone. Thyroid nodules are more common in older adults.\nThyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid. It causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of your thyroid gland.\nToo much iodine. Iodine is found in some medicines, cough syrups, seaweed and seaweed-based supplements. Taking too much of them can cause your thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone.\nToo much thyroid medicine. This can happen if people who take thyroid hormone medicine for hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) take too much of it.\nWho is at risk for hyperthyroidism?\nYou are at higher risk for hyperthyroidism if you:\nAre a woman\nAre older than age 60\nHave been pregnant or had a baby within the past 6 months\nHave had thyroid surgery or a thyroid problem, such as goiter\nHave a family history of thyroid disease\nHave pernicious anemia , in which the body cannot make enough healthy red blood cells because it does not have enough vitamin B12\nHave type 1 diabetes or primary adrenal insufficiency, a hormonal disorder\nGet too much iodine, from eating large amounts of foods containing iodine or using iodine-containing medicines or supplements\nWhat are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism?\nThe symptoms of hyperthyroidism can vary from person to person and may include:\nNervousness or irritability\nFatigue\nMuscle weakness\nTrouble tolerating heat\nTrouble sleeping\nTremor , usually in your hands\nRapid and irregular heartbeat\nFrequent bowel movements or diarrhea\nWeight loss\nMood swings\nGoiter, an enlarged thyroid that may cause your neck to look swollen. Sometimes it can cause trouble with breathing or swallowing.\nAdults over age 60 may have different symptoms than younger adults. For example, they may lose their appetite or withdraw from other people. Sometimes this can be mistaken for depression or dementia .\nWhat other problems can hyperthyroidism cause?\nIf hyperthyroidism isn't treated, it can cause some serious health problems, including:\nAn irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots , stroke , heart failure , and other heart problems\nAn eye disease called Graves' ophthalmopathy. It can cause double vision, light sensitivity, and eye pain. In rare cases, it can lead to vision loss .\nThinning bones and osteoporosis\nFertility problems in women\nComplications in pregnancy, such as premature birth , low birth weight , high blood pressure in pregnancy , and miscarriage\nHow is hyperthyroidism diagnosed?\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\nA medical history, including asking about symptoms\nA physical exam\nThyroid tests , such as TSH , T3 , T4 , and thyroid antibody blood tests Imaging tests , such as a thyroid scan, ultrasound , or radioactive iodine uptake test. A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it.\nTSH , T3 , T4 , and thyroid antibody blood tests\nImaging tests , such as a thyroid scan, ultrasound , or radioactive iodine uptake test. A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it.\nWhat are the treatments for hyperthyroidism?\nThe treatments for hyperthyroidism include medicines, radioiodine therapy, and thyroid surgery:\nMedicines for hyperthyroidism include Antithyroid medicines, which cause your thyroid to make less thyroid hormone. You probably need to take the medicines for 1 to 2 years. In some cases, you might need to take the medicines for several years. This is the simplest treatment, but it is often not a permanent cure. Beta blocker medicines, which can reduce symptoms such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. They work quickly and can help you feel better until other treatments take effect.\nAntithyroid medicines, which cause your thyroid to make less thyroid hormone.

This is the simplest treatment, but it is often not a permanent cure.\nBeta blocker medicines, which can reduce symptoms such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. They work quickly and can help you feel better until other treatments take effect.\nRadioiodine therapy is a common and effective treatment for hyperthyroidism. It involves taking radioactive iodine by mouth as a capsule or liquid. This slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone. It does not affect other body tissues. Almost everyone who has radioactive iodine treatment later develops hypothyroidism. This is because the thyroid hormone-producing cells have been destroyed. But hypothyroidism is easier to treat and causes fewer long-term health problems than hyperthyroidism.\nSurgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland is done in rare cases. It might be an option for people with large goiters or pregnant women who cannot take antithyroid medicines. If you have all of your thyroid removed, you will need to take thyroid medicines for the rest of your life. Some people who have part of their thyroid removed also need to take medicines.\nIf you have hyperthyroidism, it's important not to get too much iodine.

PCOS affects the ovaries, as well as many other parts of the body.\nPeople with PCOS usually have at least two of these problems:\nNot ovulating. Normally, your ovaries make the egg that is released each month as part of a healthy menstrual cycle . This is called ovulation. But with PCOS, the egg may not develop as it should, or it may not be released during ovulation. Your periods may be irregular, or you may not have them at all.\nHigh levels of androgens. Androgens are hormones that are important for normal male sexual development. Women normally make smaller amounts of androgens. Having higher levels of androgens can cause you to have extra body or facial hair (called hirsutism).\nCysts in one or both ovaries. Cysts are growths that are small, fluid-filled sacs.\nWhat causes polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?\nThe exact cause of PCOS in unknown. Research has shown that different factors may play a role, including:\nGenetics . PCOS tends to run in families.\nImbalances in androgen levels.\nInsulin resistance. This is a condition in which your body can't use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood glucose (sugar) into your cells to give them energy. Insulin resistance can lead to high blood glucose levels.\nWhat are the symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?\nPCOS often develops as young as age 11 or 12, around the time of your first period. But you can develop it later.\nThe symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people have few or even no symptoms. They may not realize they have PCOS until they have trouble getting pregnant. Other people may have more severe symptoms.\nThe symptoms of PCOS may include:\nIrregular or missed menstrual periods.\nToo much hair on the face, chest, stomach, or thighs.\nObesity , weight gain, or trouble losing weight.\nSevere acne which may be hard to treat.\nOily skin.\nPatches of thickened dark skin (called acanthosis nigricans).\nInfertility . PCOS is one of the most common causes of infertility. But many women with PCOS can still get pregnant.\nWhat other health problems are linked to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?\nPCOS is linked to many other health problems, including:\nInsulin resistance, which can lead to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes .\nHeart disease . Having PCOS increases your risk, and this risk goes up as you age.\nHigh blood pressure .\nHigh LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and low HDL (\"good\") cholesterol . This increases your risk of heart disease .\nSleep apnea , a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing during sleep.\nDepression and anxiety .\nAlthough there are links between PCOS and these conditions, researchers do not know whether:\nPCOS causes some of these problems\nSome of these problems cause PCOS, or\nThere are other conditions that cause both PCOS and these other health problems\nNot everyone who has PCOS will have all these problems. However, you and your health care provider may want to monitor your health for signs of them, so they can be treated early.\nHow is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed?\nThere is no specific test for PCOS. To find out if you have PCOS, your provider:\nWill do a physical exam, which will include looking for the physical signs of PCOS.\nWill ask about your medical history and family health history.\nMay do a pelvic exam to check for signs of extra male hormones and to see if your ovaries are enlarged or swollen.\nMay order a pelvic ultrasound to look for cysts on your ovaries and check the thickness of your endometrium (the lining of your uterus, or womb).\nMay order blood tests, including tests to check your hormone levels.\nWhat are the treatments for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?\nThere is no cure for PCOS, but treatments can help you manage your symptoms.

It is important to manage your diabetes and get regular eye exams.", "body_text": "What is diabetes?\nDiabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose , or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.\nWith type 1 diabetes , your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes , your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood glucose levels.\nWhat eye problems can diabetes cause?\nOver time, high blood glucose may damage the blood vessels and lenses in your eyes. This can lead to serious diabetic eye problems which can harm your vision and sometimes cause blindness . Some common diabetic eye problems include:\nDiabetic retinopathy , which is the leading cause of blindness in American adults. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). The blood vessels may swell and leak fluid into your eye. If it's not treated, it can cause serious problems such as vision loss and retinal detachment , where the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of your eye.\nDiabetic macular edema (DME) , which happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula (the part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision). This usually develops in people who already have other signs of diabetic retinopathy.\nGlaucoma , a group of eye diseases that can damage the optic nerve (the bundle of nerves that connects the eye to the brain). Glaucoma from diabetes happens when the blood vessels in the front of your eye are damaged, and new blood vessels grow near the iris (the colored part of your eye). The blood vessels block the space where fluid drains from your eye. This causes fluid to build up and pressure to increase inside your eye.\nCataract , which is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. It happens when the clear lens in the front of your eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts are common as people age. But people with diabetes are more likely to develop cataracts younger and faster than people without diabetes. Researchers think that high glucose levels cause deposits to build up in the lenses of your eyes.\nWho is more likely to develop diabetic eye problems?\nAnyone with diabetes can develop diabetic eye disease. But your risk of developing it is higher if you have diabetes and:\nHave had diabetes for a long time\nDon't have good control over your high blood glucose or high blood pressure\nAre pregnant\nHave high blood cholesterol\nSmoke tobacco\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetic eye problems?\nIn the early stages, diabetic eye problems usually don't have any symptoms. That's why regular dilated eye exams are so important, even if you think your eyes are healthy.\nYou should also watch for sudden changes in your vision that could be signs of an emergency. Call your eye care professional right away if you notice any of these symptoms:\nMany new spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision (floaters)\nFlashes of light\nA dark shadow over part of your vision, like a curtain\nVision loss\nEye pain or redness\nTalk with your eye care professional if you have these symptoms, even if they come and go:\nSpots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision\nBlurry or wavy vision\nVision that changes a lot\nTrouble seeing colors\nHow are diabetic eye problems diagnosed?\nEye care professionals do dilated eye exams to diagnose eye problems. A dilated eye exam uses eye drops to open your pupils wide so your eye care professional can look for signs of eye problems and treat them before they harm your vision. They will also test your vision and measure the pressure in your eyes.\nWhat are the treatments for diabetic eye problems?\nTreatment for diabetic eye problems depends on the problem and how serious it is. Some of the treatments include:\nLasers to stop blood vessels from leaking\nInjections (shots) in the eye to stop new, leaky blood vessels from growing\nSurgery to remove blood and scar tissue or replace a cloudy lens\nEye drops to lower fluid pressure in the eye\nBut these treatments aren't cures. Eye problems can come back. That's why your best defense against serious vision loss is to take control of your diabetes and get regular eye exams. It's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol in a healthy range.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases", "content_hash": "06623e0aa6a9bf8fbbcb8cb865759a75ca000116c46a24203fbb2781c7761de4", "word_count": 769, "char_count": 4421, "text_length": "long", "readability_score": 9.013, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["eye", "diabetic eye problems", "eye problems", "diabetic eye", "blood", "blood vessels", "vision", "problems", "diabetic", "diabetes"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "Diabetic eye problems such as diabetic retinopathy can harm your vision and sometimes cause blindness.

{"url": "https://medlineplus.gov/hyperglycemia.html", "title": "Hyperglycemia", "description": "Hyperglycemia means high blood sugar or glucose. Hyperglycemia happens when your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it the right way.", "body_text": "What is blood glucose?\nBlood glucose , or blood sugar, is the main sugar found in your blood. It is your body's primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy.\nFor people with diabetes , your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.\nWhat is hyperglycemia?\nHyperglycemia means high blood glucose. It most often affects people who have diabetes. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it the right way. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.\nWhat causes hyperglycemia?\nA key part of managing diabetes is controlling your blood glucose levels. To do this, you need to follow a diabetes meal plan and get regular physical activity . You might also need to take diabetes medicines. You have to balance all of these to keep your blood glucose at the right levels. But if you eat too much food or the wrong foods, don't take your medicines correctly, or don't get physical activity, you can get hyperglycemia. It can also happen if you are stressed or sick.\nLess commonly, people who don't have diabetes can also get hyperglycemia. It can be caused by conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood. They include problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands , certain medicines, and severe illnesses.\nWhat are the symptoms of hyperglycemia?\nThe symptoms of hyperglycemia include:\nFeeling thirsty\nFeeling tired or weak\nHeadaches\nUrinating (peeing) often\nBlurred vision\nIf you are diabetic and you often have high blood glucose levels or the symptoms of hyperglycemia, talk with your health care team. You may need a change in your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or diabetes medicines.\nIf you don't have diabetes and you are having these symptoms, see your provider to find out the cause and how to treat it.\nWhat other problems can hyperglycemia cause?\nIf hyperglycemia is not treated, it can cause other problems. In people with diabetes, long-term hyperglycemia can lead to serious health problems (diabetes complications).\nIf your blood glucose levels get very high, you can develop diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA). It happens when your body doesn't have enough insulin to allow blood glucose into your cells for use as energy. Instead, your liver breaks down fat for fuel. This process produces acids called ketones. When too many ketones are produced too fast, they can build up to dangerous levels in your body. This can be life-threatening.\nThe symptoms of DKA may include:\nTrouble breathing\nNausea or vomiting\nPain in your abdomen (belly)\nConfusion\nFeeling very tired or sleepy\nIf you have an an at-home test for ketones, check your ketone level every 4 to 6 hours when your blood glucose is very high or when you are having these symptoms. If the test shows that your ketones are moderate or high, or if you don't have a ketones test, contact your health care provider right away or get emergency medical help.\nHow is hyperglycemia diagnosed?\nIf you have diabetes, you'll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that it's not too high. You can do this with a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.\nThere are also blood tests that providers can use to check if your blood glucose is too high.\nWhat are the treatments for hyperglycemia?\nIf you have diabetes and often have high blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines.\nIf you have severe hyperglycemia and are having symptoms of DKA, you will need treatment at the hospital. The treatment often includes I.V. (intravenous) fluids and insulin.\nCan hyperglycemia be prevented?\nIf you have diabetes, managing your diabetes can help prevent hyperglycemia.

POI is different from premature menopause. Learn about the causes, and how to treat the symptoms and complications.", "body_text": "What is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?\nPrimary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature ovarian failure, happens when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40.\nMany women naturally experience reduced fertility when they are about 40 years old. They may start getting irregular menstrual periods as they transition to menopause. For women with POI, irregular periods and reduced fertility start before the age of 40. Sometimes it can start as early as the teenage years.\nPOI is different from premature menopause . With premature menopause, your periods stop before age 40. You can no longer get pregnant. The cause can be natural or it can be a disease, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. With POI, some women still have occasional periods. They may even get pregnant. In most cases of POI, the cause is unknown.\nWhat causes primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?\nIn about 90% of cases, the exact cause of POI is unknown.\nResearch shows that POI is related to problems with the follicles. Follicles are small sacs in your ovaries. Your eggs grow and mature inside them. One type of follicle problem is that you run out of working follicles earlier than normal. Another is that the follicles are not working properly. In most cases, the cause of the follicle problem is unknown. But sometimes the cause may be:\nGenetic disorders such as Fragile X syndrome and Turner syndrome\nA low number of follicles\nAutoimmune diseases, including thyroiditis and Addison disease\nChemotherapy or radiation therapy\nMetabolic disorders\nToxins, such as cigarette smoke , chemicals, and pesticides\nWho is at risk for primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?\nCertain factors can raise a woman's risk of POI:\nFamily history. Women who have a mother or sister with POI are more likely to have it.\nGenes. Some changes to genes and genetic conditions put women at higher risk for POI. For example, women Fragile X syndrome or Turner syndrome are at higher risk.\nCertain diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and viral infections\nCancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy\nAge. Younger women can get POI, but it becomes more common between the ages of 35-40.\nWhat are the symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?\nThe first sign of POI is usually irregular or missed periods. Later symptoms may be similar to those of natural menopause:\nHot flashes\nNight sweats\nIrritability\nPoor concentration\nDecreased sex drive\nPain during sex\nVaginal dryness\nFor many women with POI, trouble getting pregnant or infertility is the reason they go to their health care provider.\nWhat other problems can primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) cause?\nSince POI causes you to have lower levels of certain hormones, you are at greater risk for other health conditions, including:\nAnxiety and depression. Hormonal changes caused by POI can contribute to anxiety or lead to depression .\nDry eye syndrome and eye surface disease. Some women with POI have one of these eye conditions. Both can cause discomfort and may lead to blurred vision. If not treated, these conditions can cause permanent eye damage.\nHeart disease. Lower levels of estrogen can affect the muscles lining the arteries and can increase the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries. These factors increase your risk of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).\nInfertility.\nLow thyroid function. This problem also is called hypothyroidism . The thyroid is a gland that makes hormones that control your body's metabolism and energy level. Low levels of thyroid hormones can affect your metabolism and can cause very low energy, mental sluggishness, and other symptoms.\nOsteoporosis. The hormone estrogen helps keep bones strong. Without enough estrogen, women with POI often develop osteoporosis . It is a bone disease that causes weak, brittle bones that are more likely to break .\nHow is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) diagnosed?\nTo diagnose POI, your health care provider may do:\nA medical history, including asking whether you have relatives with POI\nA pregnancy test, to make sure that you are not pregnant\nA physical exam, to look for signs of other disorders that could be causing your symptoms\nBlood tests, to check for certain hormone levels. You may also have a blood test to do a chromosome analysis. A chromosome is the part of a cell that contains genetic information.\nA pelvic ultrasound, to see whether or not the ovaries are enlarged or have multiple follicles\nHow is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) treated?\nCurrently, there is no proven treatment to restore normal function to a woman's ovaries. But there are treatments for some of the symptoms of POI. There are also ways to lower your health risks and treat the conditions that POI can cause:\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT is the most common treatment. It gives your body the estrogen and other hormones that your ovaries are not making. HRT improves sexual health and decreases the risks for heart disease and osteoporosis. You usually take it until about age 50; that's about the age when menopause usually begins.\nCalcium and vitamin D supplements. Because women with POI are at higher risk for osteoporosis, you should take calcium and vitamin D every day.\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF).

{"url": "https://medlineplus.gov/bloodglucose.html", "title": "Blood Glucose", "description": "Your body processes the food you eat into glucose. Your blood carries glucose (blood sugar) to all of your body's cells to use for energy. Learn more.", "body_text": "What is blood glucose?\nBlood glucose, or blood sugar, is the main sugar found in your blood. It is your body's primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy.\nWhat is diabetes?\nDiabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose levels are too high. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious health problems (diabetes complications). So if you have diabetes, it's important to keep your blood glucose levels within your target range.\nWhat are blood glucose targets?\nIf you have diabetes, your blood glucose target is the range you try to reach as much as possible. The typical targets are:\nBefore a meal: 80 to 130 mg/dL\nTwo hours after the start of a meal: Less than 180 mg/dL\nYour blood glucose targets may be different, depending on your age, any additional health problems you have, and other factors. Talk with your health care team about the best target range for you.\nWhen and how should I check my blood glucose?\nIf you have diabetes, you'll likely need to check your blood glucose every day to make sure that your blood glucose numbers are in your target range. Some people may need to check their blood glucose several times a day. Ask your health care team how often you need to check it.\nThe most common way to check your blood glucose level at home is with a blood glucose meter. A blood glucose meter measures the amount of glucose in a small sample of blood, usually from your fingertip.\nContinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is another way to check your glucose levels. Most CGM systems use a tiny sensor that is inserted under your skin. The sensor measures your glucose level every few minutes. It can show changes in your glucose level throughout the day and night. A CGM system is especially useful for people who take insulin and have problems with low blood glucose.\nYour provider will also check your blood glucose with a blood test called an A1C . It checks your average blood glucose level over the past three months. People with diabetes usually have an A1C test at least twice a year. But you may need the test more often if you aren't meeting your diabetes treatment goals.\nWhat happens if my blood glucose level becomes too high?\nHigh blood glucose is called hyperglycemia . Symptoms that your blood glucose levels may be too high include:\nFeeling thirsty\nFeeling tired or weak\nHeadaches\nUrinating (peeing) often\nBlurred vision\nIf you often have high blood glucose levels or symptoms of high blood glucose, talk with your health care team. You may need a change in your diabetes meal plan , physical activity plan, or diabetes medicines .\nHigh blood glucose may also be caused by other conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood. These conditions include problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands .\nWhat happens if my blood glucose level becomes low for me?\nHypoglycemia , also called low blood glucose, happens when your blood glucose level drops below what is healthy for you. For many people with diabetes, this means a blood glucose reading lower than 70 mg/dL. Your number might be different, so check with your health care team to find out what blood glucose level is low for you.\nSymptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include:\nShaking\nSweating\nNervousness or anxiety\nIrritability or confusion\nDizziness\nHunger\nLow blood glucose levels can be common in people with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes who take certain diabetes medicines. If you think you may have low blood glucose, check your level, even if you don't have symptoms. Low blood glucose can be dangerous and should be treated as soon as possible.\nAlthough it's rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such as liver disease , kidney disease , and hormone deficiencies (lack of certain hormones). Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines and antibiotics , can also cause it. See your provider to find out the cause of your low blood glucose and how to treat it.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases", "content_hash": "e721af6018580daf1f71263d980d4ac82cf6716e319d41300f8e62bdefe045a7", "word_count": 799, "char_count": 4573, "text_length": "long", "readability_score": 8.121, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["blood glucose", "blood", "glucose", "low blood glucose", "blood glucose level", "High blood glucose", "low blood", "glucose level", "diabetes", "blood glucose targets"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "Your body processes the food you eat into glucose.

A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it.\nWhat are the treatments for hypothyroidism?\nThe treatment for hypothyroidism is medicine to replace the hormone that your own thyroid can no longer make. About 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking the medicine, you will get a blood test to check your thyroid hormone level. Your health care provider will adjust your dose if needed. Each time your dose is adjusted, you'll have another blood test. Once you find the right dose, you will probably get a blood test in 6 months. After that, you will need the test once a year.\nIf you take your medicine according to the instructions, you usually should be able to control the hypothyroidism. You should never stop taking your medicine without talking with your health care provider first.\nIf you have Hashimoto's disease or other types of autoimmune thyroid disorders, you may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine. Talk to your health care provider about which foods, supplements, and medicines you need to avoid.\nWomen need more iodine when they are pregnant because the baby gets iodine from the mother's diet.

{"url": "https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticfoot.html", "title": "Diabetic Foot", "description": "Over time, high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves or blood vessels. This can lead to foot problems. Know how to care for diabetic feet.", "body_text": "What is diabetes?\nDiabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar , levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.\nWith type 1 diabetes , your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes , your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose can't get into your cells as quickly as usual. The glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.\nHow does diabetes cause foot problems?\nFoot problems are common in people with diabetes. They can happen over time when high blood sugar damages the nerves and blood vessels in the feet. The nerve damage, called diabetic neuropathy , can cause numbness, tingling, pain, or a loss of feeling in your feet.\nIf you can't feel pain, you may not know when you have a cut, blister , or ulcer (open sore) on your foot. A wound like that could get infected. The infection may not heal well because the damaged blood vessels can cause poor blood flow in your feet.\nHaving an infection and poor blood flow can lead to gangrene . That means the muscle, skin, and other tissues start to die. If you have gangrene or a foot ulcer that does not get better with treatment, you may need an amputation . This is a surgery to cut off your damaged toe, foot, or part of your leg. It may prevent a bad infection from spreading and could save your life.\nBut there's a lot you can do to prevent a foot wound from becoming a major health problem.\nHow can I protect my feet if I have diabetes?\nThe best way to protect your feet is by controlling your blood sugar levels every day. This will help keep nerve and blood vessel damage from getting worse. The next step is to keep the skin of your feet healthy.\nGood foot care for people with diabetes includes:\nChecking your feet every day. Look for cuts, redness, and other changes in the skin and toenails, including warts or other spots that your shoes could rub. Make sure to check the bottoms of your feet too.\nWashing your feet every day. Use warm water and soap. Don't soak your feet because that can dry out your skin. After you dry your feet, you can use talcum powder or cornstarch between your toes. They soak up moisture that can cause infection. If you use lotion, don't apply it between your toes.\nAsking your doctor how to remove corns and calluses safely. Thick skin on your feet can rub and lead to sores. But removing it the wrong way could damage your skin. So you don't want to cut the skin or use medicated pads or liquid removers.\nTrimming your toenails straight across with a clipper. If it's hard for you to trim your own toenails, or if they're thick or curve into the skin, have a podiatrist (foot doctor) do it for you.\nAlways wearing well-fitting shoes and socks or slippers to protect your feet when walking. You don't want to walk barefoot, even indoors. And be sure your shoes are smooth inside. A seam or pebble could rub your skin raw.\nProtecting your feet from heat and cold. Use sunscreen on exposed skin and don't walk barefoot at the beach. In cold weather, wear warm socks instead of warming your feet near a heater or fireplace.\nKeeping the blood flowing in your feet. Put your feet up when you're sitting. Wiggle your toes and circle your feet throughout the day. Don't wear tight socks. And get plenty of activity that's not too hard on the feet, such as walking.\nGetting your feet checked at your health care visits. Even if you haven't noticed a problem, it's good to have your health care provider look at your feet.\nWhen should I see my health care provider about diabetic foot problems?\nSerious foot problems can develop quickly. See your health care provider right away if you notice:\nA cut, blister, or bruise on your feet that doesn't start to heal in a few days\nRed, warm, or painful skin on your feet\nA callus with dried blood inside\nA foot infection that becomes black and smells bad that could be gangrene\nRemember, controlling your blood sugar and caring for your feet every day are the best steps you can take to prevent serious diabetic foot problems.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases", "content_hash": "74f6d8ecc226450c4c7135e1bfc3dc47704d5eef54b066be605184a1c3d12457", "word_count": 770, "char_count": 4225, "text_length": "long", "readability_score": 7.009, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["feet", "blood", "foot", "skin", "diabetes", "blood sugar", "foot problems", "glucose", "sugar", "high blood sugar"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "Over time, high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves or blood vessels.

Besides being the leading cause of cancer in the United States, smoking tobacco harms most organs of your body and causes many other health problems.\nTobacco smoke contains many chemicals and can even be harmful even if you don't smoke. Exposure to secondhand smoke can increase the risk of cancer and other diseases. If you're pregnant , it can harm your fetus.\nIt can be difficult to quit smoking. That's because smoking also causes addiction to nicotine, a stimulant drug in tobacco. Nicotine addiction makes it harder to stop, but quitting smoking can improve the quality and length of your life.\nWhat are the benefits of quitting smoking?\nTobacco use is the most common preventable cause of death. The more years you smoke and the more cigarettes you smoke each day, the higher your risk. Quitting smoking can help reduce your risk of health problems as well as improve the quality of your life.\nSome initial benefits of quitting include:\nLower heart rate and blood pressure\nLess carbon monoxide in the blood (carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen)\nBetter circulation\nLess coughing and wheezing\nSense of smell and taste return\nIn the long term, quitting tobacco can help you live a longer life. Your risk of getting cancer decreases with each year you stay smoke-free.\nHow can I quit smoking?\nThere are many ways to quit smoking. Common methods used to help quit smoking include:\nCounseling with a health care provider about your smoking habits, readiness to quit, and setting a quit date.\nSmoking aids such as nicotine replacement products or medicines to help reduce nicotine addiction. These may not be right for you if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, a teenager, or if you have certain medical issues or take certain medicines.\nSmoking reduction by slowly reducing the number of cigarettes per day, or stopping smoking altogether, often called \"cold turkey.\"\nYou may need to try different things, but a mixture of counseling and quit-smoking medicine has been shown to be the best method.\nSome people think that switching to e-cigarettes can help to quit smoking, but that has not been proven. These battery-operated smoking devices look like cigarettes but work differently. Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. Researchers still have a lot to learn about the health effects of using e-cigarettes.\nWhen you stop or cut back on smoking, you may have short-term effects such as irritability, anxiety, moodiness, weight gain, or trouble sleeping. These are called withdrawal symptoms. You can work with your provider to help reduce these symptoms and find the best way for you to quit.\nNIH: National Cancer Institute", "content_hash": "8d086c9a7ac7279ab5e046cb01631f67639562ab8a5129240e1dc8e467f0cab3", "word_count": 452, "char_count": 2741, "text_length": "medium", "readability_score": 8.085, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["smoking", "quit", "quit smoking", "Quitting", "tobacco", "Quitting smoking", "health", "United States", "smoke", "risk"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "Quitting smoking is important for your health.

It can improve overall health and fitness, and reduce risk for many chronic diseases.", "body_text": "What are the basics of exercise and physical fitness?\nExercise is anything that gets your body moving. Regular exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health. It has many benefits , including improving your overall health and fitness, and reducing your risk for many chronic (long-term) diseases.\nEvery physical fitness routine is built on a few simple ideas. These include:\nMake exercise a habit, as your body adapts to the type of activity you do most often. Regular practice will help you improve.\nBuild up your activity level slowly to help you continue to get stronger, faster, or more flexible without pushing too hard all at once.\nChallenge yourself by lifting slightly heavier weights, adding a few more minutes to your walk, or increasing your pace.\nMix up your workouts to keep things interesting and help prevent injuries or burnout.\nShow up regularly, even for short sessions, to help you continue to make progress.\nWhat are the different types of exercise?\nThere are many different types of exercise. Before you start, check with your health care provider, especially if you have trouble moving, balancing, or worry that exercise might not be safe for you.\nA few main types of exercise include:\nAerobic exercises such as walking, running, or swimming are sometimes referred to as cardio. This is short for cardiovascular exercise. These exercises increase your breathing and heart rate. They keep your heart, lungs, and circulatory system healthy and improve your overall fitness.\nStrength, or resistance training, exercises use weights, resistance bands, or your own body weight to build stronger muscles.\nBalance exercises, such as tai chi or standing on one leg, improve your stability and coordination. They may make it easier for you to walk on uneven surfaces and help prevent falls .\nFlexibility exercises, such as stretching or yoga, help your joints move more easily and improve your posture.\nMost people benefit from a combination of these types of exercises. Your provider can help you choose the best type or amount of activity for you based on your fitness level and health.\nHow can I fit exercise into my day?\nFitting regular exercise into your daily schedule may seem difficult at first. But you can start slowly and break your exercise time into chunks. Even small amounts of exercise can be helpful. You can work your way up to doing the recommended amount of exercise. How much exercise you need depends on your age and health.\nTo get started, you don't need fancy equipment, but having the right tools can make it easier and more fun. There are a variety of places where you can exercise and create a routine that fits your lifestyle. This includes:\nAt home. Dumbbells, kettlebells, a mat, or resistance bands are versatile and affordable options for strength training and stretching. A treadmill, a stationary bike, or a workout video are a few options for indoor cardio.\nA fitness center, gym, or health club. These places offer equipment, classes, and sometimes personal trainers for guidance and support. Ask if you can try the center before you join, and if staff are available to show you how to use the exercise equipment.\nOutdoors. Try riding a bike, walking your dog, or exploring local parks and trails. Dress for the weather and protect yourself from the sun . If safety is a concern, choose a well-lit neighborhood, a busy park, or even an indoor shopping mall for your walk.\nInclude activities that strengthen all parts of your body, especially your core, which are the muscles in your abdomen (belly), back, and hips. A strong core helps with balance and stability and can lower your risk of back injuries .\nIf you haven't exercised in a while , start slowly and talk to your provider if you have health concerns. If you don't feel right, or have any pain, extreme shortness of breath , or dizziness , stop exercising and seek help right away.\nHow can I stay motivated?\nEven with the best intentions, it's easy to fall off track. Here are some ways to keep going:\nChoose activities you enjoy. It's easier to make exercise a regular part of your life if you have fun doing it.\nExercise safely . Use the proper equipment to prevent injuries , listen to your body, and don't overdo it.\nGive yourself goals. Your goals should be challenging, but realistic. It may be helpful to reward yourself when you reach them. The rewards could be something big, like new workout gear, or something smaller, such as a new water bottle or movie tickets.\nMix it up. Try a new class, playlist, Podcast, or outdoor route when things get stale.\nFind an accountability partner. Exercise with a friend, join a group challenge, or check in with an online community.\nUse wearable technology. A pedometer or an app like a fitness tracker on your phone or other device can help you track your progress.", "content_hash": "4a3d6f56be1ee51e0bcd30a9bf6fdd171fa05d60694c1fb3dae04b99ab69c84c", "word_count": 827, "char_count": 4836, "text_length": "long", "readability_score": 7.203, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["exercise", "exercises", "fitness", "health", "Make", "Make exercise", "body", "types", "Regular exercise", "improve"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "Regular exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health.

A different kind of oxygen therapy is called hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Find out more.", "body_text": "What is oxygen?\nOxygen is a gas that your body needs to work properly. Your cells need oxygen to make energy. Your lungs absorb oxygen from the air you breathe. The oxygen enters your blood from your lungs and travels to your organs and body tissues.\nCertain medical conditions can cause your blood oxygen levels to be too low. Low blood oxygen may make you feel short of breath , tired, and confused. It can also damage your body. Oxygen therapy can help you get more oxygen.\nWhat is oxygen therapy?\nOxygen therapy is a treatment that provides you with extra oxygen to breathe in. It is also called supplemental oxygen. It is only available through a prescription from your health care provider. You may get it in the hospital, another medical setting, or at home. Some people only need it for a short period of time. Others will need long-term oxygen therapy.\nThere are different types of devices that can give you oxygen. Some use tanks of liquid or gas oxygen. Others use an oxygen concentrator, which pulls oxygen out of the air. You will get the oxygen through a nose tube (cannula), a mask, or a tent. The extra oxygen is breathed in along with normal air.\nThere are portable versions of the tanks and oxygen concentrators. They can make it easier for you to move around while using your therapy.\nWho needs oxygen therapy?\nYou may need oxygen therapy if you have a condition that causes low blood oxygen, such as:\nCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)\nPneumonia\nCOVID-19\nA severe asthma attack\nLate-stage heart failure\nCystic fibrosis\nSleep apnea\nWhat are the risks of using oxygen therapy?\nOxygen therapy is generally safe, but it can cause side effects. They include a dry or bloody nose, tiredness, and morning headaches.\nOxygen poses a fire risk, so you should never smoke or use flammable materials when using oxygen. If you use oxygen tanks, make sure your tank is secured and stays upright. If it falls and cracks or the top breaks off, the tank can fly like a missile.\nWhat is hyperbaric oxygen therapy?\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a different type of oxygen therapy. It involves breathing oxygen in a pressurized chamber or tube. That allows your lungs to gather up to three times more oxygen than you would get by breathing oxygen at normal air pressure. The extra oxygen moves through your blood and to your organs and body tissues.\nHBOT is used to treat certain serious wounds , burns , injuries, and infections. It also treats air or gas embolisms (bubbles of air in your bloodstream), decompression sickness suffered by divers, and carbon monoxide poisoning .\nBut some treatment centers claim that HBOT can treat almost anything, including Alzheimer's disease , autism , cancer , and Lyme disease . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not cleared or approved the use of HBOT for these conditions. There are risks to using HBOT, so always check with your provider before you try it.", "content_hash": "0de310481bf6678f2538ba1a3bd6a3e16dc4af352e8bb6ce5a298eb89e0abba1", "word_count": 508, "char_count": 2929, "text_length": "long", "readability_score": 6.664, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["oxygen", "Oxygen therapy", "therapy", "HBOT", "blood oxygen", "blood", "air", "Low blood oxygen", "extra oxygen", "body"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "Oxygen therapy is a treatment that provides extra oxygen.

They include strong prescription pain relievers , such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid.\nA health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some health care providers prescribe them for chronic pain .\nPrescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your provider. However, opioid use disorder (OUD) is still a possible risk.\nWhat is opioid use disorder (OUD)?\nOpioid use disorder (OUD) means that you have a problematic pattern of using opioids. The pattern causes a lot of distress and impairment (meaning that it causes problems in and interferes with your daily life). Instead of OUD, sometimes people use the terms \"opioid dependence\" and \"opioid addiction.\" Dependence means feeling withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that causes a person to compulsively seek out drugs, even though they cause harm.\nWhat are the treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD)?\nTreatments for OUD include:\nMedicines; this kind of treatment is known as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD)\nCounseling and behavioral therapies\nResidential and hospital-based treatment\nWhich medicines treat opioid opioid use disorder (OUD)?\nThe medicines used in MOUD are methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone:\nMethadone, buprenorphine, and lofexidine, which can decrease withdrawal symptoms and cravings.

You may also talk about legal concerns and family problems. Counseling often includes specific behavioral therapies, such as\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps you recognize and stop negative patterns of thinking and behavior. It teaches you coping skills, including how to manage stress and change the thoughts that cause you to want to misuse opioids.\nMotivational enhancement therapy , which helps you build up motivation to stick with your treatment plan.\nContingency management , which focuses on giving you incentives for positive behaviors such as staying off the opioids.\nGroup counseling , which can help you feel that you are not alone with your issues.

For example, surgery for a severe heart attack may need to be done right away. In other cases, you can plan heart surgery ahead of time. Some heart surgeries are major operations, such as heart bypass surgery for blocked arteries in the heart. Other surgeries are more minor heart procedures, such as putting in a pacemaker.\nWhat conditions does heart surgery treat?\nThere are different types of heart surgery that can help treat many heart conditions:\nAn implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to help prevent sudden cardiac arrest .\nA biventricular pacemaker to coordinate the heart's pumping action so it's more powerful.\nA ventricular assist device to help the heart pump blood.\nA total artificial heart to pump blood for the heart.\nWhat approaches do surgeons use to do heart surgery?\nThe approach a surgeon uses to do heart surgery depends on your heart problem, your general health, and other factors. Approaches to heart surgery include:\nOpen-heart surgery (also called traditional heart surgery) is when the surgeon cuts the chest open to reach the heart. Because it's difficult to operate on a beating heart, medicines are used to stop the heart. A heart-lung bypass machine keeps oxygen-rich blood pumping through the body during the surgery.\nOff-pump heart surgery is open-heart surgery on a beating heart without using a heart-lung bypass machine. The surgeon holds the heart steady with a device. Surgeons may use off-pump heart surgery to do coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), but only in certain cases.\nMinimally invasive heart surgery uses small cuts between the ribs. The cuts may be as small as 2 to 3 inches. The surgeon inserts tools into the chest through the cuts. This type of heart surgery may or may not use a heart-lung bypass machine.\nRobotic-assisted surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery. The surgeon uses a computer to control tools on the arms of a robot. This allows the surgeon to be very accurate when doing difficult operations.\nWhat are the risks of heart surgery?\nLike all surgery, heart surgery has risks even though the results are often excellent. The risks include:\nBleeding\nInfection, fever , and swelling\nA problem from anesthesia (medicine that makes you sleep during surgery)\nArrhythmia\nDamage to the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs\nStroke\nThe risks of heart surgery tend to be higher if:\nThe surgery is an emergency.\nYou have other medical conditions, including: Diabetes Kidney diseases Lung diseases Peripheral artery disease (PAD)\nDiabetes\nKidney diseases\nLung diseases\nPeripheral artery disease (PAD)\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute", "content_hash": "9c7965ebd55a9aa63e4749f6ca0a2c1561145dce5a92186660f5a7b95481fbb9", "word_count": 454, "char_count": 2802, "text_length": "medium", "readability_score": 7.961, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["heart surgery", "heart", "surgery", "surgeon", "Off-pump heart surgery", "bypass", "Lung diseases Peripheral", "blood", "Kidney diseases Lung", "Open-heart surgery"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "Heart surgery is used to fix certain problems with the heart.

It can cause pain and damage in the bones. Learn more.", "body_text": "What is Paget's disease of bone?\nPaget's disease of bone is a chronic bone disorder. Normally, there is a process in which your bones break down and then regrow. In Paget's disease, this process is abnormal. There is excessive breakdown and regrowth of bone. Because the bones regrow too quickly, they are bigger and softer than normal. They may be misshapen and easily fractured (broken). Paget's usually affects just one or a few bones.\nWhat causes Paget's disease of bone?\nResearchers do not know for sure what causes Paget's disease. Environmental factors may play a role. In some cases, the disease runs in families, and several genes have been linked to the disease.\nWho is at risk for Paget's disease of bone?\nThe disease is more common in older people and those of northern European heritage. If you have a close relative who has Paget's, you are much more likely to have it.\nWhat are the symptoms of Paget's disease of bone?\nMany people do not know that they have Paget's, because it often has no symptoms. When there are symptoms, they are similar to those of arthritis and other disorders. The symptoms include:\nPain , which may be due to the disease or to arthritis, which can be a complication of Paget's\nHeadaches and hearing loss , which can happen when Paget's disease affects the skull\nPressure on the nerves , which can happen when Paget's disease affects the skull or spine\nIncreased head size, bowing of a limb, or curvature of the spine. This can happen in advanced cases.\nHip pain , if Paget's disease affects the pelvis or thighbone\nDamage to the cartilage of your joints , which may lead to arthritis\nUsually, Paget's disease gets worse slowly over time. It does not spread to normal bones.\nWhat other problems can Paget's disease of bone cause?\nPaget's disease can lead to other complications, such as:\nArthritis, because the misshapen bones can cause increased pressure and more wear and tear on the joints\nHeart failure . In severe Paget's disease, the heart has to work harder to pump blood to affected bones. Heart failure is more likely if you also have hardening of the arteries .\nKidney stones , which can happen when the excessive breakdown of the bone leads to extra calcium in the body\nNervous system problems , since the bones can cause pressure on the brain, spinal cord, or nerves. There may also be reduced blood flow to the brain and spinal cord.\nOsteosarcoma, cancer of the bone\nLoose teeth, if Paget's disease affects the facial bones\nVision loss , if Paget's disease in the skull affects the nerves. This is rare.\nHow is Paget's disease of bone diagnosed?\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\nA medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\nA physical exam\nAn x-ray of the affected bones. Paget's disease is almost always diagnosed using x-rays.\nAn alkaline phosphatase blood test\nA bone scan\nSometimes the disease is found by accident when one of these tests is done for another reason.\nWhat are the treatments for Paget's disease of bone?\nTo avoid complications, it is important to find and treat Paget's disease early. The treatments include:\nMedicines. There are several different medicines to treat Paget's disease. The most common type is bisphosphonates. They help reduce bone pain and stop or slow down the progress of the disease.\nSurgery is sometimes needed for certain complications of the disease. There are surgeries to Allow fractures (broken bones) to heal in a better position Replace joints such as the knee and hip when there is severe arthritis Realign a deformed bone to reduce the pain in weight-bearing joints, especially the knees Reduce pressure on a nerve, if enlargement of the skull or spine injuries effects the nervous system\nAllow fractures (broken bones) to heal in a better position\nReplace joints such as the knee and hip when there is severe arthritis\nRealign a deformed bone to reduce the pain in weight-bearing joints, especially the knees\nReduce pressure on a nerve, if enlargement of the skull or spine injuries effects the nervous system\nDiet and exercise do not treat Paget's, but they can help to keep your skeleton healthy. If you do not have kidney stones, you should make sure to get enough calcium and vitamin D through your diet and supplements. Besides keeping your skeleton healthy, exercise can prevent weight gain and maintain the mobility of your joints. Talk with your health care provider before you start a new exercise program. You need to make sure that the exercise does not put too much stress on the affected bones.\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases", "content_hash": "2726ed3bd333c5d2e7d6633a2f40039025078a4e61a30841e57f32dac9cb51fc", "word_count": 792, "char_count": 4634, "text_length": "long", "readability_score": 8.743, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["Paget disease", "Paget", "Paget disease affects", "disease", "treat Paget disease", "bone", "bones", "severe Paget disease", "treat Paget", "disease affects"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "Paget's disease of bone causes your bones to grow too large and weak.

It can also happen if the structure and strength of your bones change.\nOsteoporosis is called a \"silent\" disease because it doesn't usually cause symptoms. You may not even know you have the disease until you break a bone. This could happen with any bone, but it's most common in the bones of your hip, vertebrae in the spine, and wrist.\nWhat causes osteoporosis?\nYour bones are made of living tissue. To keep them strong, your body breaks down old bone and replaces it with new bone. Osteoporosis develops when more bone is broken down than replaced. You lose bone mass and changes happen in the structure of your bone tissue. This can happen as you get older. Other risk factors can also lead to the development of osteoporosis or increase your chance of developing the disease.\nWho is more likely to develop osteoporosis?\nAnyone can develop osteoporosis, but you are more likely to develop it if you have one or more risk factors:\nYour sex. Osteoporosis is more common in women, especially after menopause (postmenopausal).\nYour age. Your risk increases as you get older. It is most common in people over age 50.\nYour body size. It is more common in people who are slim and thin boned.\nYour race: White and Asian women are at highest risk. African American and Mexican American women have a lower risk. White men are at higher risk than African American and Mexican American men.\nWhite and Asian women are at highest risk.\nAfrican American and Mexican American women have a lower risk.\nWhite men are at higher risk than African American and Mexican American men.\nFamily history. Your risk of osteoporosis may be higher if one of your parents has osteoporosis or broke their hip.\nChanges to hormones . Low levels of certain hormones can increase your chance of developing osteoporosis.\nDiet. A diet that is low in calcium and/or vitamin D or does not include enough protein can raise your risk.\nLong-term use of certain medicines, such as: Corticosteroids Proton pump inhibitors (which treat GERD ) Medicines to treat epilepsy\nCorticosteroids\nProton pump inhibitors (which treat GERD )\nMedicines to treat epilepsy\nHaving other medical conditions, such as: Endocrine diseases Certain digestive diseases Rheumatoid arthritis Certain types of cancer HIV Anorexia nervosa, a type of eating disorder\nEndocrine diseases\nCertain digestive diseases\nRheumatoid arthritis\nCertain types of cancer\nHIV\nAnorexia nervosa, a type of eating disorder\nYour lifestyle. Certain lifestyle factors can contribute to bone loss, such as: Smoking tobacco Long-term heavy alcohol use Physical inactivity or prolonged periods of bedrest\nSmoking tobacco\nLong-term heavy alcohol use\nPhysical inactivity or prolonged periods of bedrest\nWhat are the symptoms of osteoporosis?\nOsteoporosis usually doesn't cause symptoms. You may not know that you have it until you break a bone.\nHow is osteoporosis diagnosed?\nHealth care providers often diagnose osteoporosis during routine screening for the disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for:\nWomen age 65 and older\nPostmenopausal women under age 65 who have factors that increase the chance of developing osteoporosis\nFor men, it isn't clear yet whether regular screening is helpful. More research is needed to know for sure.\nTo find out if you have osteoporosis, your provider:\nWill ask about your medical history and whether you have ever broken a bone\nMay do a physical exam, which could include checking for: A loss of height and/or weight Changes in your posture Balance and gait (the way you walk) Your muscle strength\nA loss of height and/or weight\nChanges in your posture\nBalance and gait (the way you walk)\nYour muscle strength\nWill likely order a bone density scan\nMay do a fracture risk assessment, which is a short questionnaire that helps estimate your risk of breaking a bone in the next 10 years\nWill likely order a bone density scan\nMay do a fracture risk assessment, which is a short questionnaire that helps estimate your risk of breaking a bone in the next 10 years\nWhat are the treatments for osteoporosis?\nThe goals for treating osteoporosis are to slow or stop bone loss and to prevent fractures. Your provider may recommend:\nA healthy, balanced diet that includes enough calcium, vitamin D, and protein\nLifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and limiting alcohol\nRegular physical activity including weight-bearing exercise (like walking), strength training, and balance exercises\nFall prevention to help prevent fractures\nMedicines, such as: Medicines that slow down bone loss Medicines that help rebuild bone\nMedicines that slow down bone loss\nMedicines that help rebuild bone\nIn addition to managing your osteoporosis, it's important to avoid activities that may cause a fracture. These can include movements that involve:\nTwisting your spine, like swinging a golf club\nBending forward from the waist, like sit ups and toe touches\nYou can also help reduce the risk of breaking a bone by preventing falls.\nCan osteoporosis be prevented?\nTo help keep bones strong and help prevent osteoporosis, the best thing to do is to eat a healthy diet rich in calcium and vitamin D. Getting regular physical activity, limiting alcohol, and not smoking can also help.\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases", "content_hash": "cf2d73c428ca31ada4d5cb2ce5696d0622c47e24529427a773819cbade850ec3", "word_count": 898, "char_count": 5499, "text_length": "long", "readability_score": 8.966, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["bone", "osteoporosis", "Mexican American", "risk", "American", "African American", "Mexican American women", "medicines", "American and Mexican", "disease"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "Osteoporosis is a disease that weakens your bones and makes them more likely to break or fracture.

They include strong prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. Some opioids are made from the opium plant, and others are synthetic (man-made).\nA health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some providers prescribe them for chronic pain .\nWhat are the side effects and risks of opioids?\nOpioids can cause side effects such as drowsiness, mental fog, nausea, and constipation. They may also cause slowed breathing, which can lead to overdose deaths. If someone has signs of an overdose , call 911. These signs may include:\nVery small pupils of the eyes\nFalling asleep or loss of consciousness\nSlow, shallow breathing\nChoking or gurgling sounds\nVomiting\nLimp body\nPale, blue, or cold skin\nFaint heartbeat\nPurple lips and fingernails\nWhen using opioids, there is also a risk of opioid use disorder (OUD).\nWhat is opioid use disorder (OUD)?\nOpioid use disorder (OUD) means that you have a problematic pattern of using opioids. The pattern causes a lot of distress and impairment (meaning that it causes problems in and interferes with your daily life). Instead of OUD, sometimes people use the terms \"opioid dependence\" and \"opioid addiction.\" Dependence means feeling withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that causes a person to compulsively seek out drugs, even though they cause harm.\nThe risk of OUD is higher if you misuse the medicines . Misuse can include taking more than your prescribed dose or taking it more often, using it to get high, or taking someone else's opioids.\nOpioid use disorder and overdoses are serious public health problems in the United States. As more people misuse opioids, more women are misusing opioids during pregnancy . This can lead to health risks for the mother and baby. The baby may be born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS is a group of withdrawal symptoms that a baby has after being exposed to drugs during pregnancy.\nAnother problem with increased opioid misuse is that it can also lead to more heroin use. There are some people who switch from prescription opioids to heroin because heroin may be cheaper and easier to get.\nHow are opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid overdose treated?\nThere are effective medicines to treat OUD . Using medicines to treat OUD is called medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). MOUD can help you stop using the drug, get through withdrawal, and cope with cravings. It is often combined with behavioral therapy and counseling. Having support from family and friends can also help.\nThere is also a medicine called naloxone which can treat opioid overdoses. It can reverse the effects of the overdose and prevent death if it is given quickly.\nHow can I prevent problems when taking prescription opioids?\nTo prevent problems with prescription opioids , be sure to follow your doctor's instructions when taking them. Do not share your medicines with anyone else.

They interfere with your life, but you cannot control or stop them.\nWhat causes obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?\nThe cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, and your environment may play a role.\nWho is at risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) usually begins when you are a teen or young adult. Boys often develop OCD at a younger age than girls.\nRisk factors for OCD include:\nFamily history. People with a first-degree relative (such as a parent, sibling, or child) who has OCD are at higher risk. This is especially true if the relative developed OCD as a child or teen.\nBrain structure and functioning. Imaging studies have shown that people with OCD have differences in certain parts of the brain. Researchers need to do more studies to understand the connection between the brain differences and OCD.\nChildhood trauma, such as child abuse . Some studies have found a link between trauma in childhood and OCD. More research is needed to understand this relationship better.\nIn some cases, children may develop OCD or OCD symptoms following a streptococcal infection . This is called Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS).\nWhat are the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?\nPeople with OCD may have symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, or both:\nObsessions are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety . They may involve things such as Fear of germs or contamination Fear of losing or misplacing something Worries about harm coming towards yourself or others Unwanted forbidden thoughts involving sex or religion Aggressive thoughts towards yourself or others Needing things lined up exactly or arranged in a particular, precise way\nFear of germs or contamination\nFear of losing or misplacing something\nWorries about harm coming towards yourself or others\nUnwanted forbidden thoughts involving sex or religion\nAggressive thoughts towards yourself or others\nNeeding things lined up exactly or arranged in a particular, precise way\nCompulsions are behaviors that you feel like you need to do over and over to try to reduce your anxiety or stop the obsessive thoughts.

Tics are sudden twitches, movements, or sounds that people do over and over. People who have tics cannot stop their body from doing these things.\nHow is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) diagnosed?\nThe first step is to talk with your health care provider about your symptoms. It's important to check whether a physical problem is causing your symptoms. So your provider will do a physical exam and will ask you about your medical history. If your symptoms do not seem to be caused by a physical problem, your provider may do an OCD test or may refer you to a mental health specialist for further evaluation or treatment.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can sometimes be hard to diagnose. Its symptoms are like those of other mental disorders, such as anxiety disorders. It is also possible to have both OCD and another mental disorder.\nNot everyone who has obsessions or compulsions has OCD. Your symptoms would usually be considered OCD when you:\nCan't control your thoughts or behaviors, even when you know that they are excessive\nSpend at least 1 hour a day on these thoughts or behaviors\nDon't get pleasure when performing the behaviors. But doing them may briefly give you relief from the anxiety.\nHave significant problems in your daily life because of these thoughts or behaviors\nWhat are the treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?\nThe main treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are cognitive behavioral therapy, medicines, or both:\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy. It teaches you different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to your obsessions and compulsions. Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) s a specific type of CBT. ERP involves gradually exposing you to your fears or obsessions. You learn healthy ways to deal with the anxiety they cause.\nExposure and Response Prevention (ERP) s a specific type of CBT. ERP involves gradually exposing you to your fears or obsessions. You learn healthy ways to deal with the anxiety they cause.\nMedicines for OCD include certain types of antidepressants . If those don't work for you, your provider may suggest taking some other type of psychiatric medicine.\nIf you have severe OCD that does not get better with these treatments, your provider may suggest a treatment called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). It is a brain stimulation procedure that uses magnetic waves. It can target specific brain areas associated with OCD.\nNIH: National Institute of Mental Health", "content_hash": "d945773c062a42570dd761cb5a2654bc66e4355287873a4b30d358fc9038277a", "word_count": 856, "char_count": 5480, "text_length": "long", "readability_score": 8.754, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["OCD", "obsessive-compulsive disorder", "obsessive-compulsive", "disorder", "thoughts", "things", "symptoms", "obsessions", "OCD include", "mental"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "People with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) suffer from frequent, upsetting thoughts called obsessions.

It is different from being overweight, which means weighing too much. Both terms mean that your weight is greater than what's considered healthy for your height.\nBody Mass Index (BMI) measures how much you weigh compared to how tall you are. An adult who has a BMI of 30 or more is considered to have obesity. Severe obesity is having a BMI of 40 or higher. Obesity increases your risk for many other diseases and health problems, especially if the extra body fat is carried around the waist.\nWhat raises your risk of obesity?\nObesity happens over time from taking in more calories (through food and drinks) than used up from physical activity and daily living. Your body stores the extra calories as fat. The right balance between calories and activity is different for everyone.\nThere are many different factors that can affect your body weight . Certain medicines or medical conditions may affect your weight. Other factors include your:\nGenetic makeup\nEating habits\nSex\nRace or ethnicity\nPhysical activity level\nHow is obesity diagnosed?\nTo find out if you have obesity, your health care provider may:\nAsk about your health history , which may include reviewing your weight history, weight-loss efforts, and how physically active you are.\nDo a physical exam , which may include checking your height, weight, and vital signs , as well as listening to your heart and lungs.\nOrder blood tests or other imaging tests , which may include checking any known health problems, as well as for other weight-related diseases and health conditions.\nCalculate your BMI , to check your risk for certain diseases. The higher your BMI, the higher your risk. BMI does not distinguish between fat, muscle, and bone mass. It may also overestimate body fat in athletes or those with a muscular build, or underestimate body fat in older persons, or others who have lost muscle.\nCheck your waist size , since a large waistline, with more body fat around your abdomen (belly) rather than your hips, increases your risk for weight-related health problems.\nWhat health problems can obesity cause?\nHaving a larger body size can make your heart work harder, put extra pressure on your joints, and may increase your risk for many health conditions, including:\nType 2 diabetes .\nHeart disease .\nHigh blood pressure .\nStroke .\nMetabolic syndrome .\nOsteoarthritis .\nSleep apnea .\nPregnancy problems .\nFertility problems .\nSome cancers.\nIf you have obesity, losing even 5 to 10% of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases. For example, that means losing 10 to 20 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds.\nWhat are the treatments for obesity?\nTreatment plans for obesity may depend on your overall weight, other health conditions, and your willingness to participate in a weight-loss plan .\nYour provider can tell you what a healthy weight is for you, help you set goals, and give you tips on how to lose weight. They may refer you to other providers that specialize in nutrition or weight loss to help you make realistic goals and provide support.\nPossible treatments may include:\nDietary changes and exercise goals to help you learn how to adopt healthy nutrition, exercise , and lifestyle changes to lose weight safely and keep it off long term.\nCounseling or support groups can give you encouragement and help you understand what's behind weight changes.\nWeight-loss medicines to treat obesity.\nWeight loss procedures or surgery if you have severe obesity or serious obesity-related health problems and have not been able to lose enough weight.\nA healthy lifestyle that includes healthy eating patterns and regular physical activity can help you lose weight and lower your chance of developing complications related to obesity.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases", "content_hash": "817df8bc20feb51c5d882067656222d309555f82dcb1c5b307af81876e0d639d", "word_count": 645, "char_count": 3853, "text_length": "long", "readability_score": 7.482, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["obesity", "weight", "BMI", "health", "body", "body fat", "health problems", "fat", "problems", "risk"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "Read about the causes of obesity and find out what you can do to decrease your risk of its associated health issues.", "questions": ["What is obesity?", "What raises your risk of obesity?", "How is obesity diagnosed?", "What health problems can obesity cause?", "What are the treatments for obesity?"], "fetched_at": 1764224803}

Learn who is at risk, how much vitamin D you need, and how to get enough.", "body_text": "What is vitamin D deficiency?\nVitamin D deficiency means that your body is not getting enough vitamin D to stay healthy.\nWhy do I need vitamin D and how do I get it?\nVitamin D helps your body absorb calcium . Calcium is one of the main building blocks of bone. Vitamin D also has a role in your nervous, muscle, and immune systems.\nYou can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin, from your diet, and from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D naturally after exposure to sunlight. But too much sun exposure can lead to skin aging and skin cancer, so many people try to get their vitamin D from other sources.\nHow much vitamin D do I need?\nThe amount of vitamin D you need each day depends on your age. The recommended amounts, in international units (IU), are:\nBirth to 12 months: 400 IU\nChildren 1-13 years: 600 IU\nTeens 14-18 years: 600 IU\nAdults 19-70 years: 600 IU\nAdults 71 years and older: 800 IU\nPregnant and breastfeeding women: 600 IU\nPeople at high risk of vitamin D deficiency may need more. Check with your health care provider about how much you need.\nWhat causes vitamin D deficiency?\nYou can become deficient in vitamin D for different reasons:\nYou don't get enough vitamin D in your diet\nYou don't absorb enough vitamin D from food (a malabsorption problem )\nYou don't get enough exposure to sunlight\nYour liver or kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form in the body\nYou take medicines that interfere with your body's ability to convert or absorb vitamin D\nWho is at risk of vitamin D deficiency?\nSome people are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency:\nBreastfed infants, because human milk is a poor source of vitamin D. If you are breastfeeding , give your infant a supplement of 400 IU of vitamin D every day.\nOlder adults, because your skin doesn't make vitamin D when exposed to sunlight as efficiently as when you were young, and your kidneys are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form.\nPeople with dark skin, which has less ability to produce vitamin D from the sun.\nPeople with conditions that make it difficult to absorb nutrients from food, such as Crohn's disease , ulcerative colitis , and celiac disease .\nPeople who have obesity , because their body fat binds to some vitamin D and prevents it from getting into the blood.\nPeople who have had gastric bypass surgery, a type of weight loss surgery which creates a bypass of part of the small intestine. Since vitamin D is absorbed there, bypassing part of it makes it harder to absorb enough vitamin D.\nPeople with chronic kidney or liver disease , which can affect your ability to change vitamin D into a form your body can use.\nPeople who take medicines that affect vitamin D levels, including certain cholesterol , anti-seizure, steroid , and weight-loss medicines.\nTalk with your provider if you are at risk for vitamin D deficiency. There is a blood test that can measure how much vitamin D is in your body.\nWhat problems does vitamin D deficiency cause?\nVitamin D deficiency can lead to a loss of bone density , which can contribute to osteoporosis and fractures (broken bones).\nSevere vitamin D deficiency can also lead to other diseases:\nIn children, it can cause rickets . Rickets is a rare disease that causes the bones to become soft and bend. African American infants and children are at higher risk of getting rickets.\nIn adults, severe vitamin D deficiency leads to osteomalacia. Osteomalacia causes weak bones, bone pain, and muscle weakness.\nHow can I get more vitamin D?\nThere are a few foods that naturally have some vitamin D:\nFatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel\nBeef liver\nCheese\nMushrooms\nEgg yolks\nYou can also get vitamin D from fortified foods. You can check the food labels to find out whether a food has vitamin D. Foods that often have added vitamin D include:\nMilk\nBreakfast cereals\nOrange juice\nOther dairy products, such as yogurt\nSoy drinks\nVitamin D is in many multivitamins. There are also vitamin D supplements, both in pills and in a liquid for babies.\nIf you have vitamin D deficiency, the treatment is with supplements. Check with your provider about how much you need to take, how often you need to take it, and how long you need to take it.\nCan too much vitamin D be harmful?\nGetting too much vitamin D (known as vitamin D toxicity) can be harmful. Signs of toxicity include nausea and vomiting , poor appetite, constipation , weakness, and weight loss.\nVery high levels of vitamin D can damage the kidneys. It also raises the level of calcium in your blood. High levels of blood calcium (hypercalcemia) can cause confusion, kidney failure , and irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia).\nMost cases of vitamin D toxicity happen when someone overuses vitamin D supplements. You cannot get too much vitamin D from sun exposure because the skin limits the amount of vitamin D it makes.", "content_hash": "31d742a4f16a5557cd57e8c4476cd436ef26913b18f6589f26cfd12bab765f92", "word_count": 859, "char_count": 4834, "text_length": "long", "readability_score": 8.781, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["vitamin", "vitamin D deficiency", "deficiency", "people", "body", "convert vitamin", "skin", "Severe vitamin", "Adults", "risk"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "A lack of vitamin D (deficiency) can affect your bones and overall health.

{"url": "https://medlineplus.gov/cancer.html", "title": "Cancer", "description": "If you or someone you love has been diagnosed with cancer, learn about diagnosis, treatment, risk factors, coping and much more.", "body_text": "What is cancer?\nCancer is not just one disease but many diseases. Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Usually, your body forms new cells as needed, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor.\nTumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer, while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of your body. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the type of cancer and how advanced it is.\nWhat are the types of cancer?\nThere are more than 100 different types of cancer. Cancer can start almost anywhere in your body. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast.\nCancer may also be described by the type of cell that formed it, such as sarcoma if cancer begins in your bone and soft tissue. Carcinoma is the most common type of cancer. It is formed by epithelial cells, the cells that cover the inside and outside surfaces of your body.\nHow does cancer develop?\nCancer is a genetic disease. That means changes in your genes cause it. Changes in your genes are also called gene variants or mutations. Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. However, only some cancers are caused by genes passed down from your parents.\nGenetic changes can occur to your genes over your lifetime that affect how your cells function. Usually, your body gets rid of damaged cells before they turn cancerous, but this ability goes down as you age. Other factors that may affect your risk of developing cancer can include:\nExposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun\nSmoking\nYour diet\nPhysical inactivity\nWhat are the symptoms of cancer?\nCancer symptoms depend on the type of cancer. For example, some of the symptoms that cancer may cause can include:\nA lump in your breast\nBlood in your urine (pee) or stool (poop)\nBleeding or bruising for no known reason\nA sore that doesn't heal\nTrouble swallowing\nA new mole or a change to a mole you already have\nCancer may cause various symptoms but often doesn't cause pain. Don't wait until you're having pain before seeing your health care provider. See your provider if you have symptoms that don't get better in a few weeks.\nHow is cancer diagnosed?\nThere is no single test that can diagnose cancer.

You can take steps to help prevent an overdose, and respond to one with naloxone.", "body_text": "What are opioids?\nOpioids, sometimes called narcotics, are a type of drug. They include strong prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid.\nA health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some providers prescribe them for chronic pain .\nPrescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your provider. However, people who take opioids are at risk for opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose . These risks increase when these medicines are misused. Misuse can include taking more than your prescribed dose or taking it more often, using it to get high, or taking someone else's opioids.\nWhat is an opioid overdose?\nOpioids affect the part of the brain that regulates breathing. When people take high doses of opioids, it can lead to an overdose, with the slowing or stopping of breathing and sometimes death.\nWhat causes an opioid overdose?\nAn opioid overdose can happen for a variety of reasons, including if you:\nTake an opioid to get high.\nTake an extra dose of a prescription opioid or take it too often (either accidentally or on purpose).\nMix an opioid with other medicines, illegal drugs, or alcohol. An overdose can be fatal when mixing an opioid and certain anxiety treatment medicines, such as Xanax or Valium.\nTake an opioid medicine that was prescribed for someone else. Children are especially at risk of an accidental overdose if they take medicine not intended for them.\nThere is also a risk of overdose if you are getting medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). MOUD is a treatment for OUD . Many of the medicines used for MOUD are also controlled substances that can be misused.\nWho is at risk of an opioid overdose?\nAnyone who takes an opioid can be at risk of an overdose, but you are at higher risk if you:\nTake illegal opioids\nTake more opioid medicine than you are prescribed\nCombine opioids with other medicines and/or alcohol\nHave certain medical conditions, such as sleep apnea , or reduced kidney or liver function\nAre over 65 years old\nWhat are the signs of an opioid overdose?\nThe signs of an opioid overdose include:\nVery small pupils of the eyes\nFalling asleep or loss of consciousness\nSlow, shallow breathing\nChoking or gurgling sounds\nVomiting\nLimp body\nPale, blue, or cold skin\nFaint heartbeat\nPurple lips and fingernails\nWhat should I do if I think that someone is having an opioid overdose?\nIf you think someone is having an opioid overdose:\nCall 911 immediately .\nGive the person naloxone, if it is available. Naloxone is a safe medication that can quickly stop an opioid overdose. There are two forms. One is a nasal spray that you spray info the nose. The other type is injected into the muscle under the skin, or into the veins. Naloxone works by blocking the effects of the opioids on the body. It's important to read the product instructions and check the expiration date before you give it to someone.\nTry to keep the person awake and breathing.\nLay the person on their side to prevent choking.\nStay with the person until emergency workers arrive.\nNaloxone won't harm someone if they're overdosing on drugs other than opioids, so it's best to use it if you think someone is overdosing.\nCan an opioid overdose be prevented?\nIf you are taking opioid pain medicine, there are steps you can take to help prevent an opioid overdose:\nTake your medicine exactly as prescribed by your provider. Do not take more medicine at once or take medicine more often than you are supposed to.\nNever mix the pain medicines with alcohol, sleeping pills, or illegal substances.\nStore your medicine safely where children or pets can't reach it. Consider using a medicine lockbox. Besides keeping children safe, it also prevents someone who lives with you or visits your house from stealing your medicines.\nDispose of unused medicine promptly.\nIt is also important to teach your family and friends how to respond to an overdose.

It's the most common type of arthritis.\nIn a healthy joint, the ends of the bones are covered with a smooth, slippery tissue called cartilage. The cartilage pads the bones and helps them glide easily when you move the joint. With osteoarthritis, the cartilage breaks down and becomes rough. Sometimes, all the cartilage wears away and the bones rub together. Bumps of extra bone called bone spurs may grow in the joint area.\nThere is no cure for osteoarthritis. It usually gets worse slowly. But there's a lot you can do to manage the symptoms.\nWhat are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?\nOsteoarthritis affects people in different ways, and not everyone has pain. The most common symptoms are:\nPain when you move, which often gets better with rest\nStiffness, especially for the first 30 minutes after you get up from resting\nSwollen joints, especially after using the joint a lot\nLess movement in the joint than normal\nA joint that feels loose or unstable\nWhat causes osteoarthritis?\nResearchers aren't sure what causes osteoarthritis. They think that it could be caused by a combination of factors in the body and the environment. Your chance of developing osteoarthritis increases with age. They also know that some people are more likely to develop it than others.\nWho is more likely to develop osteoarthritis?\nThings that make you more likely to develop osteoarthritis include:\nAging. Osteoarthritis can happen at any age, but the chance of getting it increases in middle-aged adults and older. After age 50, it is more common in women than in men.\nBeing overweight. Extra weight puts more stress on your joints.\nHaving a past injury or surgery on a joint. This is often the cause of osteoarthritis in younger adults.\nDoing a lot of activities that overuse the joint. This includes sports with a lot of jumping, twisting, running, or throwing.\nHaving a joint that doesn't line up correctly.\nA family history of osteoarthritis. Some people inherit genetic changes that increase their chance of developing osteoarthritis.\nHow is osteoarthritis diagnosed?\nThere is no specific test for osteoarthritis. To find out if you have osteoarthritis, your provider:\nWill ask about your symptoms and medical history\nWill do a physical exam\nMay use x-rays or other imaging tests to look at your joints\nMay order lab tests to make sure that a different problem isn't causing your symptoms\nWhat are the treatments for osteoarthritis?\nThe goal of treating osteoarthritis is to ease your pain, help you move better, and stop it from getting worse.\nTreatment usually begins with:\nExercises to improve strength, flexibility and balance\nWeight loss, if needed, to improve pain, especially in your hips or knees\nBraces or shoe inserts (orthotics) that a health care provider fits for you\nYou can buy some pain relievers and arthritis creams without a prescription. They can be helpful, but it's best to talk to your provider about using them. If they don't help enough, your provider may prescribe injections (shots) into the joint or prescription pain relievers.\nComplementary therapies may help some people. Massage can increase blood flow and bring warmth to the area. Some research shows that acupuncture may help relieve osteoarthritis pain.

It's about feeling good, having energy, and lowering your risk of disease. Your health care provider can help you determine a healthy body weight based on several factors. These include your:\nBody Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a measure of how much you weigh compared to how tall you are. The higher your BMI, the higher your risk for certain diseases. BMI does not distinguish between fat, muscle, and bone mass. It also may overestimate body fat in athletes or those with a muscular build, or underestimate body fat in older persons or others who have lost muscle.\nWaist circumference.

To keep them strong, your body breaks down old bone and replaces it with new bone. But when more bone is broken down than replaced, you lose bone density, also called bone mass. Bone density is a measure of the amount of calcium and other minerals in bone. Bones containing more minerals are denser. They tend to be stronger and less likely to fracture (break).\nLosing bone density can weaken your bones. In some cases, it can lead to osteoporosis . This is a disease which can make your bones more likely to break. Low bone density that is not low enough to be osteoporosis is sometimes called osteopenia.\nWhat can make you lose bone density?\nYour bones become less dense as you age.

Learn about withdrawal symptoms and addiction treatment.", "body_text": "What is heroin?\nHeroin is an illegal, very addictive opioid drug . It's made from morphine, which comes from the seedpod of opium poppy plants. These plants grow in Southeast and Southwest Asia, Mexico, and Colombia. Heroin can be a white or brown powder, or a black sticky substance known as black tar heroin.\nHow do people use heroin?\nPeople inject, sniff, snort, or smoke heroin. Some people mix heroin with crack cocaine , which is called \"speedballing.\" All these ways of taking heroin send it to the brain very quickly, which makes it highly addictive.\nWhat are the short-term effects of heroin?\nPeople who use heroin report feeling a \"rush\" (a surge of pleasure). And then they may feel other effects, such as a warm flushing of the skin, dry mouth , and a heavy feeling in the arms and legs. They may also have severe itching , nausea, and vomiting . After these first effects, they will usually be drowsy for several hours, and their breathing will slow down.\nWhat are the long-term effects of heroin?\nPeople who use heroin over the long term may develop many different health problems. These problems could include liver , kidney , and lung disease, mental disorders , and abscesses .\nPeople who inject the drug also risk getting infectious diseases such as HIV , hepatitis , and bacterial infections of the skin, bloodstream, and heart ( endocarditis ). They can also get collapsed veins. When a vein collapses, the blood cannot flow through it.\nRepeated use of heroin can lead to tolerance. This means users need more and more of the drug to have the same effect. At higher doses over time, the body becomes dependent on heroin. If someone who is dependent on heroin stops using it, they have withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms can include restlessness, muscle and bone pain, diarrhea , vomiting, and cold flashes with goose bumps.\nRepeated use of heroin often leads to heroin use disorder, sometimes called addiction. This is more than physical dependence. It's a chronic (long-lasting) brain disorder. When someone has it, they continue to use heroin even though it causes problems in their life. Some examples include health problems and not being able to meet responsibilities at work, school, or home. Getting and using heroin becomes their main purpose in life.\nCan a person overdose on heroin?\nIt's possible to overdose on heroin. This happens when a person uses so much heroin that it causes a life-threatening reaction or death. All heroin users are at risk of an overdose because they never know the actual strength of the drug they are taking or what may have been added to it. Most heroin available in the United States is combined with illegally made fentanyl (IMF). Using heroin combined with IMF, or along with other drugs or alcohol can increase the risk of an overdose.\nWhen people overdose on heroin, their heart rate and breathing slow down. Their breathing may slow do so much that not enough oxygen reaches the brain. This condition is called hypoxia. Hypoxia can lead to a coma , permanent brain damage, or death.\nHow can a heroin overdose be treated?\nA medicine called naloxone can treat a heroin (or other opioid) overdose if it is given in time. It works by blocking the effects of the opioid on the body. Sometimes more than one dose of the medicine is needed.\nThere are two forms of naloxone that anyone can use without medical training: nasal spray and injectable. People at risk of an overdose are encouraged to carry naloxone with them. They can buy naloxone at a pharmacy.\nWhat are the treatments for heroin use disorder?\nTreatments for heroin use disorder include medicines to treat withdrawal symptoms, medicine to block the effects of opioids, and behavioral treatments. Often, a combination of medicine and behavioral treatment works best. People getting treatment for heroin use disorder should work with their health care providers to come up with a treatment plan that fits their needs.\nNIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse", "content_hash": "a31c7a7197ab87598eeec3f7e69d038c85ef04415172dd47c51c7082b2e350f9", "word_count": 677, "char_count": 3975, "text_length": "long", "readability_score": 6.951, "source_domain": "medlineplus.gov", "language": "en", "keywords": ["heroin", "people", "overdose", "effects", "Southwest Asia", "Southeast and Southwest", "drug", "disorder", "problems", "risk"], "content_type": "health_topic_page", "summary": "Heroin is a highly addictive drug made from morphine.

They, along with the tonsils, are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance. The adenoids and tonsils work by trapping germs coming in through the mouth and nose.\nAdenoids usually start to shrink after about age 5. By the teenage years, they are almost completely gone. By then, the body has other ways to fight germs.\nWhat are enlarged adenoids?\nEnlarged adenoids are adenoids that are swollen. It is a common problem in children.\nWhat causes enlarged adenoids?\nYour child's adenoids can be enlarged, or swollen, for different reasons. It may just be that your child had enlarged adenoids at birth. Adenoids can also become enlarged when they are trying to fight off an infection. They might stay enlarged even after the infection is gone.\nWhat problems can enlarged adenoids cause?\nEnlarged adenoids can make it hard to breathe through the nose. Your child might end up breathing only through the mouth. This may cause:\nA dry mouth , which can also lead to bad breath\nCracked lips\nA runny nose\nOther problems that enlarged adenoids can cause include:\nLoud breathing\nSnoring\nRestless sleep\nSleep apnea , a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing during sleep\nEar infections\nHow can enlarged adenoids be diagnosed?\nTo find out if your child has enlarged adenoids, the health care provider will:\nAsk about your child's medical history, including asking about your child's symptoms\nCheck your child's ears, throat, and mouth\nFeel your child's neck\nSince the adenoids are higher up than the throat, the provider cannot see them just by looking through your child's mouth. To check the size of your child's adenoids, your provider may use:\nA special mirror in the mouth\nA long, flexible tube with a light (an endoscope)\nAn x-ray\nWhat are the treatments for enlarged adenoids?\nThe treatment depends on what is causing the problem. If the symptoms are not too bad, your child may not need treatment. If treatment is needed, your child may get nasal spray to reduce the swelling or antibiotics if the provider thinks that there is a bacterial infection.\nIn some cases, your child may need an adenoidectomy.\nWhat is an adenoidectomy and why might I my child need one?\nAn adenoidectomy is surgery to remove the adenoids. The provider may recommend this surgery if:\nYour child has repeated infections of the adenoids. Sometimes the infections can also cause ear infections and fluid buildup in the middle ear.\nTaking antibiotics doesn't get rid of a bacterial infection of the adenoids.\nThe enlarged adenoids block the airways.\nIf there is also a problem with the tonsils, your child will probably have a tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils) at the same time that the adenoids are removed.\nAfter having the surgery, your child usually goes home the same day. Your child will probably have some throat pain, bad breath, and a runny nose.

For example, you could get a cold after you shake hands with someone who has a cold or touch a doorknob that has the germs on it, and then touch your face.\nWhat are the symptoms of the common cold?\nThe symptoms of a common cold usually include:\nSneezing\nStuffy nose (congestion)\nRunny nose\nSore throat\nCoughing\nHeadache\nThe symptoms usually start a few days after you become infected with the virus. Some symptoms can last for 10-14 days.\nWhat are the treatments for the common cold?\nThere is no cure for the common cold.

Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell cancers . They begin in the moist tissues that line the head and neck. The cancer cells may spread into deeper tissue as the cancer grows.\nThere are other cancers that develop in the head and neck, such as brain cancer , eye cancer , and esophageal cancer . But they are usually not considered to be head and neck cancers, because those types of cancer and their treatments are different.\nWho is more likely to develop head and neck cancer?\nAnyone can get head and neck cancer, but you are more likely to develop it if you:\nUse tobacco or drink lots of alcohol. Your risk of developing head and neck cancer is even higher if you do both.\nAre male.\nAre over age 50.\nHave a history of head or neck cancer.\nHave HPV (for cancers in the tonsils and base of the tongue).\nAre exposed to wood dusts or certain other toxic substances at work (for upper throat, nose, and sinus cancers).\nHave had radiation exposure to the head and neck (for salivary gland cancer).\nHave Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (for upper throat and salivary gland cancers).\nAre Asian (for upper throat cancer).\nWhat are the symptoms of head and neck cancer?\nThe symptoms of head and neck cancer may include:\nA lump in the neck\nA sore in the mouth or the throat that does not heal and may be painful\nA sore throat that does not go away\nTrouble swallowing\nA change or hoarseness in the voice\nOther possible symptoms can depend on the specific type of head and neck cancer.\nHow is head and neck cancer diagnosed?\nWhich exams and tests used to diagnose head and neck cancer can depend on the specific type of cancer. Possible exams and tests may include:\nA physical exam of the area that might have cancer.\nBlood and/or urine tests.\nAn endoscopy .\nA biopsy or other procedure to collect cells from the area that might have cancer.
